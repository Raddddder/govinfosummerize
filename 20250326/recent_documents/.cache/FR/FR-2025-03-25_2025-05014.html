FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION

47 CFR Part 73

[MB Docket No. 25-139; RM-12001; DA 25-228; FR ID 285689]


Television Broadcasting Services Las Vegas, Nevada

AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission.

ACTION: Proposed rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Video Division, Media Bureau (Bureau), has before it a 
petition for rulemaking, as amended, filed by CHANNEL 33, INC. (Channel 
33 or Petitioner), the licensee of KHSV, channel 2, Las Vegas, Nevada 
(Station or KHSV). Petitioner requests that the Bureau substitute 
channel 23 for channel 2 at Las Vegas, Nevada in the Table of TV 
Allotments (table).

DATES: Comments must be filed on or before April 24, 2025 and reply 
comments on or before May 9, 2025.

ADDRESSES: Federal Communications Commission, Office of the Secretary, 
45 L Street NE, Washington, DC 20554. In addition to filing comments 
with the FCC, interested parties should serve counsel for the 
Petitioner as follows: Paul Cicelski, Esq., Lerman Senter PLLC, 2001 L 
Street NW, Suite 400, Washington, DC 20036.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Emily Harrison, Media Bureau, at 
<a href="mailto:Emily.Harrison@fcc.gov">Emily.Harrison@fcc.gov</a>, (202) 418-1665, or Mark Colombo, Media Bureau, 
at Ma<a href="mailto:rk.Colombo@fcc.gov">rk.Colombo@fcc.gov</a>, (202) 418-7611.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In its Petition, Channel 33 asserts that the 
proposed channel substitution of UHF channel 23 for low-VHF channel 2 
serves the public interest because it resolves longstanding indoor 
digital VHF reception problems experienced by Station viewers. In this 
regard, Channel 33 states that the Commission has recognized that VHF 
channels have certain characteristics that pose challenges for their 
use in providing digital television service, including propagation 
characteristics that allow undesired signals and noise to be receivable 
at relatively far distances. According to Channel 33, radiation by the 
illumination devices in Las Vegas and its casinos are known to 
interfere with low-VHF channels. In order to demonstrate that many 
persons within the channel 2 noise limited service contour (NLSC) 
currently are not receiving a viewable signal, Petitioner submits 
examples of complaints from over 200 viewers in Las Vegas city 
boundaries and immediate surrounding areas, where KHSV's signal 
strength is the strongest, reporting that they cannot reliably receive 
a viewable signal.
    Channel 33 further asserts that while the proposed channel 23 
predicted NLSC does not reach 41,840 persons who currently reside 
within the channel 2 predicted NLSC, this population number is not 
representative of the actual loss area. Petitioner explains that in 
addition to the Station operating on a low VHF channel, there are 
unique factors in Las Vegas which support a deviation from the 
Commission's general policy to only accept de minimis loss of 
population in connection with channel substitution requests. According 
to an analysis provided by Petitioner, most of the predicted loss area 
is on the fringe of the Station's protected NLSC, which extends more 
than 80 miles from the Station's antenna site as calculated by Sec.  
73.619(b)(4) of the Commission's rules (Rules). Petitioner explains 
that Las Vegas is unique in that it sits in a ``topographical bowl'' 
surrounded by ``extremely tall walls of rock'' which block the 
Station's signal from areas at the edge of the Station's NLSC, such as 
Mesquite, Nevada, Bullhead City, Arizona, and Kingman, Arizona (Fringe 
Localities). Included with its Petition are terrain maps of the Las 
Vegas area which show the extreme terrain that blocks the Station's 
signal from reaching the Fringe Localities because they do not have 
line-of-site to the KHSV antenna and, thus, cannot reliably receive the 
Station's signal. Petitioner also provides field measurements which it 
states show that KHSV's signal is largely not present in the Fringe 
Localities and in those limited locations that have a signal, it is 
``barely useable'' or the signal is in largely undeveloped or 
underdeveloped areas away from significant residential and industrial 
electronic noise. Based on this analysis, Petitioner concludes that 
changing the Station's channel ``will not create more than a de minimis 
population loss (since there is a de minimis number of viewers to start 
with) in these distant communities.''
    We believe that the Petitioner's channel substitution proposal for 
KHSV warrants consideration. Based on an analysis by Bureau staff, 
channel 23 can be substituted for channel 2 as proposed in compliance 
with the principal community coverage requirements of section 73.618 of 
the Rules, at coordinates 36-00'-31.0'' N and 115-00'-20.0'' W. In 
addition, we find that this channel change meets the technical 
requirements set forth in section 73.622(a) of the Rules. Further, 
because of the unique reception difficulties experienced on low-VHF 
channels due to the significant levels of interference from numerous 
illumination devices in Las Vegas, the topography of the Las Vegas 
area, and the measured lack of reception today in the loss areas due to 
terrain, we tentatively conclude that although total viewer loss is not 
de minimis, based on the unique facts and circumstances, the benefits 
of the proposal to the public outweigh the harms. We seek comment on 
this tentative conclusion. According to the Petitioner, 86,424 persons 
will fall outside of the Station's current channel 2 NLSC. However, 
when using Longley-Rice, which takes into account terrain loss, the 
loss population in the Fringe Localities is predicted to be less than 
half that--41,480 persons. Approximately, 44,944 persons in the Fringe 
Localities should continue to receive KHSV despite being outside the 
Station's new channel 23 NLSC contour. An analysis included by the 
Petitioner also confirms that most of the remaining loss area is served 
by translators for other stations and low power television (LPTV) 
stations. For example, nine such LPTV/translator stations exist in the 
Kingman, Arizona area. In addition, an analysis by Bureau staff agrees 
with the Petitioner that some viewers in the loss area will continue to 
be covered by other full power stations. For example, KMOH-TV, Kingman, 
AZ (Facility ID No. 24573) and KMCC(TV), Laughlin, NV (Facility ID No. 
41237) cover portions of the Fringe Localities. While we do not depend 
on these facts in tentatively concluding that the proposal warrants 
consideration, we believe that these facts help to support our 
tentative

conclusion that this proposal serves the public interest.

employees,'' pursuant to the Small Business Paperwork Relief Act of 
2002, Public Law 107-198, see 44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(4). Provisions of the 
Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 601-612, do not apply to 
this proceeding.
    Members of the public should note that all ex parte contacts are 
prohibited from the time a notice of proposed rulemaking is issued to 
the time the matter is no longer subject to Commission consideration or 
court review, see 47 CFR 1.1208. There are, however, exceptions to this 
prohibition, which can be found in Sec.  1.1204(a) of the Commission's 
rules, 47 CFR 1.1204(a).
    See Sec. Sec.  1.415 and 1.420 of the Commission's rules for 
information regarding the proper filing procedures for comments, 47 CFR 
1.415 and 1.420.
    Providing Accountability Through Transparency Act: The Providing 
Accountability Through Transparency Act, Public Law 118-9, requires 
each agency, in providing notice of a rulemaking, to post online a 
brief plain-language summary of the proposed rule. The required summary 
of this notice of proposed rulemaking is available at <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/proposed-rulemakings">https://www.fcc.gov/proposed-rulemakings</a>.
