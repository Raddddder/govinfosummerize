    Abstract: The Controlled Substances Act requires all businesses and 
individuals who manufacture, distribute, import, export, and conduct 
research and laboratory analysis with controlled substances to register 
with DEA. 21 U.S.C. 822, 21 CFR 1301.11 and 1301.13. Registration is a 
necessary control measure and helps to prevent diversion by ensuring 
the closed system of distribution of controlled substances can be 
monitored by DEA and the businesses and individuals handling controlled 
substances are qualified to do so and are accountable.
