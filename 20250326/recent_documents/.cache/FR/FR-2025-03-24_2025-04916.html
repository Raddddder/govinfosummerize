SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background

    On February 4, 2025, the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) 
initiated a countervailing duty (CVD) investigation on imports of 
temporary steel fencing from the People's Republic of China (China).\1\ 
The preliminary determination is due no later than April 10, 2025.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ See Temporary Steel Fencing from the People's Republic of 
China: Initiation of Countervailing Duty Investigation, 90 FR 9311 
(February 11, 2025).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Postponement of the Preliminary Determination

    Section 703(b)(1) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), 
requires Commerce to issue the preliminary determination in a CVD 
investigation within 65 days after the date on which Commerce initiated 
the investigation. However, section 703(c)(1) of the Act permits 
Commerce to postpone the preliminary determination until no later than 
130 days after the date on which Commerce imitated the investigation 
if: (A) the petitioner makes a timely request for a postponement; or 
(B) Commerce concludes that the parties concerned are cooperation, that 
the investigation is extraordinarily complicated, and that additional 
time is necessary to make a preliminary determination. Under 19 CFR 
351.205(e), the petitioner must submit a request for postponement 25 
days or more before the scheduled date of the preliminary determination 
and must state the reasons for the request. Commerce will grant the 
request unless it finds compelling reasons to deny the request.
    On March 4, 2025, the petitioner \2\ submitted a timely request 
that Commerce postpone the preliminary determination in this 
investigation.\3\ The petitioner stated that it requested postponement 
to extend the deadline for the preliminary determination because of the 
complexity of the issues and number of subsidy programs under 
investigation.\4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ The petitioner is ZND US Inc.
    \3\ See Petitioner's Letter, ``Temporary Steel Fencing from the 
People's Republic of China: Request to Extend the Preliminary 
Determination,'' dated March 4, 2025.
    \4\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In accordance with 19 CFR 351.205(e), the petitioner submitted its 
request for postponement of the preliminary determination in this 
investigation 25 days or more before the scheduled date of the 
preliminary determination and stated the reasons for its request. For 
the reasons stated above, and because there are no compelling reasons 
to deny the request, in accordance with section 703(c)(1)(A) of the 
Act, Commerce is postponing the deadline for the preliminary 
determination to no later than 130 days after the date on which this 
investigation was initiated, i.e., June 16, 2025.\5\ Pursuant to 
section 705(a)(1) of the Act and 19 CFR 351.210(b)(1), the deadline for 
the final determination of this investigation will continue to be 75 
days after the date of the preliminary determination.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ Postponing the deadline to 130 days after the date of 
initiation would place the deadline on Saturday, June 14, 2025. 
Commerce practice dictates that where a deadline falls on a weekend 
or Federal holiday, the appropriate deadline is the next business 
day. See Notice of Clarification: Application of ``Next Business 
Day'' Rule for Administrative Determination Deadlines Pursuant to 
the Tariff Act of 1930, As Amended, 70 FR 24533 (May 10, 2005).
