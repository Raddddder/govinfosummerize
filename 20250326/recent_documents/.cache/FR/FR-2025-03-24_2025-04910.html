ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY

40 CFR Part 52

[EPA-R02-OAR-2024-0042; FRL 12249-02-R2]


Air Plan Approval; New York; Knowlton Technologies LLC

AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

ACTION: Final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving a 
revision to the State of New York's State Implementation Plan (SIP) for 
the ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) related to a 
Source-specific SIP (SSSIP) revision for Knowlton Technologies LLC, 
located at 213 Factory Street, Watertown, New York (the Facility). The 
control options in this SSSIP revision address volatile organic 
compound (VOC) Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) for the 
Facility source identified as two 10,000-gallon underground storage 
tanks holding virgin methanol. This action is being taken in accordance 
with the requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA) for implementation of 
the 2008 and 2015 ozone NAAQS. The EPA proposed to approve this rule on 
November 26, 2024, and received no comments. This final action will not 
interfere with ozone NAAQS requirements and meets all applicable 
requirements of the CAA.

DATES: This final rule is effective on April 23, 2025.

ADDRESSES: The EPA has established a docket for this action under 
Docket ID Number EPA-R02-OAR-2024-0042. All documents in the docket are 
listed on the <a href="https://www.regulations.gov">https://www.regulations.gov</a> website. Although listed in

I. What is the background for this action?

    A SSSIP revision was submitted to the EPA by the State of New York 
on February 22, 2023, for Knowlton Technologies LLC, located at 213 
Factory Street, Watertown, New York (the Facility), and it replaces and 
withdraws the SSSIP that was submitted

[[Page 13415]]

by the State on September 16, 2008. On November 26, 2024, the EPA 
published a notice of proposed rulemaking that proposed to approve a 
SSSIP revision to address VOC RACT emission limits for the Facility's 
two underground storage tanks holding virgin methanol. See 89 FR 93239. 
Specifically, the notice of proposed rulemaking addressed the 
following: (1) RACT control options for two 10,000-gallon underground 
storage tanks holding virgin methanol; (2) Source-specific emission 
limit where the presumptive VOC limit is not technologically and 
economically feasible; and (3) a case-by-case VOC emission limit for 
the two 10,000-gallon underground storage tanks that will restrict the 
methanol throughput at the tanks to 2,500,000 pounds/year with a 12-
month rolling total.
    The EPA is determining through this final action that the VOC RACT 
emission limits included in the February 22, 2023, SSSIP revision are 
demonstrated to be RACT for the two underground storage tanks. The 
underground storage tanks have the lowest emission limits with the 
application of control technology that are reasonably available given 
the technological and economic feasibility considerations. Furthermore, 
the VOC RACT emission limits for the underground storage tanks comply 
with the New York State regulations, 6 NYCRR part 212, ``Process 
Operations,'' subpart 212-3, ``Reasonably Available Control Technology 
for Major Facilities,'' last approved into New York's SIP by the EPA on 
October 1, 2021, see 87 FR 54375 (October 1, 2021), and are contained 
in the Facility's title V operating permit, 6-2218-00017/00009. The 
permit was issued by the State on December 27, 2022, and it expires on 
December 26, 2027.
    The specific details of New York's SIP submittals and the rationale 
for the EPA's approval action are explained in the EPA's proposed 
rulemaking and are not restated in this final action. For this detailed 
information, the reader is referred to the EPA's November 26, 2024, 
proposed rulemaking. See 89 FR 93239.

II. What comments were received in response to the EPA's proposed 
action?

    The EPA provided a 45-day review and comment period for the 
November 26, 2024, proposed rulemaking. The comment period ended on 
January 10, 2025. We received no comments on the EPA's action.

III. What action is the EPA taking?

    The EPA is approving the SSSIP revision because the limits included 
in the SSSIP are demonstrated to implement RACT for the two 10,000-
gallon underground storage tanks holding virgin methanol. Based on 
information provided by NYSDEC, a review of similar sources, and an 
analysis of the February 22, 2023, SSSIP revision, the EPA is approving 
the VOC emission limits for the two tanks as implementing RACT.
    Specifically, the EPA is approving the following limits and 
associated requirements as implementing RACT: the Facility must: (1) 
Limit VOC emissions by restricting the methanol throughput to 2,500,000 
pounds/year with a 12-month rolling total; (2) maintain monthly records 
to verify the throughput in support of a 12-month rolling total; (3) 
upon any increase in throughput beyond 2,500,000 pounds/year, submit a 
VOC RACT demonstration that implements RACT at the higher methanol 
throughput rate.

IV. Incorporation by Reference

    In this document, the EPA is finalizing regulatory text that 
includes incorporation by reference. In accordance with requirements of 
1 CFR 51.5, the EPA is finalizing the incorporation by reference of the 
Knowlton Technologies VOC case-by-case RACT limit described in the 
amendments to 40 CFR part 52 as discussed in section I. of this 
preamble. These documents are available in the docket of this 
rulemaking through <a href="http://www.regulations.gov">www.regulations.gov</a>. Therefore, these materials have 
been approved by the EPA for inclusion in the State Implementation 
Plan, have been incorporated by reference by the EPA into that plan, 
are fully Federally enforceable under sections 110 and 113 of the CAA 
as of the effective date of the final rulemaking of the EPA's approval, 
and will be incorporated by reference in the next update to the SIP 
compilation.\1\

V. Statutory and Executive Order Reviews

    Under the Clean Air Act, the Administrator is required to approve a 
SIP submission that complies with the provisions of the Act and 
applicable Federal regulations. 42 U.S.C. 7410(k); 40 CFR 52.02(a). 
Thus, in reviewing SIP submissions, EPA's role is to approve State 
choices, provided that they meet the criteria of the Clean Air Act. 
Accordingly, this action merely approves State law as meeting Federal 
requirements and does not impose additional requirements beyond those 
imposed by State law. For that reason, this action:
    <bullet> Is not a significant regulatory action subject to review 
by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Orders 12866 (58 
FR 51735, October 4, 1993);
    <bullet> Does not impose an information collection burden under the 
provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.);
    <bullet> Is certified as not having a significant economic impact 
on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.);
    <bullet> Does not contain any unfunded mandate or significantly or 
uniquely affect small governments, as described in the Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-4);
    <bullet> Does not have federalism implications as specified in 
Executive Order 13132 (64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999);
    <bullet> Is not subject to Executive Order 13045 (62 FR 19885, 
April 23, 1997) because it approves a State program;
    <bullet> Is not a significant regulatory action subject to 
Executive Order 13211 (66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001); and
    <bullet> Is not subject to requirements of section 12(d) of the 
National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (15 U.S.C. 272 
note) because application of those requirements would be inconsistent 
with the Clean Air Act.
    In addition, the SIP is not approved to apply on any Indian 
reservation land or in any other area where the EPA or an Indian Tribe 
has demonstrated that a Tribe has jurisdiction. In those areas of 
Indian country, the rule does not have Tribal implications and it will 
not impose substantial direct costs on Tribal governments or preempt 
Tribal law as specified by Executive Order 13175 (65 FR 67249, November 
9, 2000).
    This action is subject to the Congressional Review Act, and the EPA 
will submit a rule report to each House of the Congress and the 
Comptroller General of the United States. This action is not a ``major 
rule'' as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2).
    Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for 
judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court 
of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by May 23, 2025. Filing a 
petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule 
does not affect the finality of this action for the purposes of 
judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for 
judicial review may be filed and shall not postpone the effectiveness 
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in 
proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2)).
