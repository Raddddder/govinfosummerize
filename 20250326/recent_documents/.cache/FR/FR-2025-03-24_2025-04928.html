SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Written comments and suggestions from the 
public and affected agencies concerning the proposed collection of 
information are encouraged. Your comments should address one or more of 
the following four points:
--Evaluate whether the proposed collection of information is necessary 
for the proper performance of the functions of the Bureau of Justice 
Statistics, including whether the information will have practical 
utility;
--Evaluate the accuracy of the agency's estimate of the burden of the 
proposed collection of information, including the validity of the 
methodology and assumptions used;
--Evaluate whether and if so how the quality, utility, and clarity of 
the information to be collected can be enhanced; and
--Minimize the burden of the collection of information on those who are 
to respond, including through the use of appropriate automated, 
electronic, mechanical, or other technological collection techniques or 
other forms of information technology, e.g., permitting electronic 
submission of responses.
    Abstract: Candidates enter information pertinent to legal 
employment on a series of electronic screens (the number of screens 
varies by Program; hiring organizations vary by year). The data is then 
certified and submitted into a database for OARM review and 
transmission to the components that consider the candidates for legal 
employment. The candidate is automatically notified by email that his/
her application has been received when he/she certifies and submits 
his/her electronic application, and provided other hiring status 
updates throughout the hiring cycle.
    In compliance with the Executive Order issued January 20, 2025, 
(<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/defending-women-from-gender-ideology-extremism-and-restoring-biological-truth-to-the-federal-government/">https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/defending-women-from-gender-ideology-extremism-and-restoring-biological-truth-to-the-federal-government/</a>), the voluntary demographic question on the HP/
SLIP application is revised to reflect ``Sex'' with the responses 
``Male,'' ``Female'' or ``Decline to Answer,'' removing references to 
gender identity and sexual orientation. There is no impact on the 
public burden or cost.
    OARM, in coordination with hiring offices, periodically reviews 
questions relating to qualifications and experience to ensure their 
focus and criteria remains relevant (e.g., assists hiring officials 
evaluate written or oral communication skills, public service interest, 
relevant experience, etc.).
    <bullet> Hiring officials requested the addition of two ``yes/no'' 
questions relating to written or oral communication skills for SLIP 
applicants. This change is limited to the questions presented to 
eligible applicants to the Summer Law Intern Program, who often have 
limited objective law school accomplishments at the time they apply. 
There is de minimis impact on the public burden and no impact on cost.
    <bullet> In addition, hiring officials requested modification to an 
existing ``check the box'' question presented to all applicants 
clarifying the type of public service experience responsive to the 
question. There is no impact on the public burden or cost to this 
change.
    <bullet> A new ``check the box'' question relating to relevant 
experience was added. There is de minimis impact on the public burden 
and no cost to this change.
    The estimate of annualized cost to the federal government decreased 
from $54,000 to $39,885.

Overview of this information collection:

    1. Type of Information Collection: Revision of a previously 
approved collection.
    2. The Title of the Form/Collection: Electronic Applications for 
the Attorney General's Honors Program and the Summer Law Intern 
Program.
    3. The agency form number, if any, and the applicable component of 
the Department sponsoring the collection: N/A
    4. Affected public who will be asked or required to respond, as 
well as the obligation to respond: Affected Public- Individuals. The 
obligation to respond is voluntary.
    5. An estimate of the total number of respondents and the amount of 
time estimated for an average respondent to respond: An estimated 2428 
candidates apply to the HP & SLIP annually. It is estimated that the 
electronic application takes approximately one hour to complete and 
submit. It is further estimated that it takes an average of an 
additional 45 minutes to review the instructions, search existing data 
sources, gather and maintain the data needed, and complete and review 
the information collected. In addition, approximately 600 HP applicants 
will complete the Virtual Interview Scheduling form. Each Interview 
Scheduling Form will take approximately 10 minutes to complete. Thus, 
the annual burden would be 4349 hours based on 2428 applicants (the 
average number of applications received in the last several years) x 
1.75 response hours (estimated time to collect the appropriate 
information and complete the Program application) plus 100 hours (time 
for 600 HP candidates to complete the Virtual Interview Scheduling 
Form).
    6. An estimate of the total annual burden (in hours) associated 
with the collection: The total annual burden hours for this collection 
is 4349 hours.
    7. An estimate of the total annual cost burden associated with the 
collection, if applicable: $39,885.
