[Docket No. FAA-2025-0442]


Agency Information Collection Activities: Requests for Comments; 
Clearance of a Renewed Approval of Information Collection: Financial 
Responsibility for Licensed Launch Activities

AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Department of 
Transportation.

ACTION: Notice and request for comments.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA 
invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information 
collection. The information to be collected will be used to determine 
if licensees have complied with financial responsibility requirements 
for maximum probable loss determination (MPL) analysis as set forth in 
FAA regulations. The FAA is responsible for determining MPL required to 
cover claims by a third party for bodily injury or property damage, and 
the United States, its agencies, and its contractors and subcontractors 
for covered property damage or loss, resulting from a Commercial space 
transportation permitted or licensed activity. The MPL determination 
forms the basis for financial responsibility requirements issued in a 
license or permit order.

DATES: Written comments should be submitted by May 27, 2025.

ADDRESSES: Please send written comments:
    By Electronic Docket: <a href="http://www.regulations.gov">www.regulations.gov</a> (Enter docket number into 
search field).
    By mail: Charles Huet, 800 Independence Avenue SW, Room 331, 
Washington, DC 20591.
    By fax: 202-267-5463.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Charles Huet by email at: 
<a href="mailto:Charles.huet@faa.gov">Charles.huet@faa.gov</a>; phone: 202-267-7427.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Public Comments Invited: You are asked to comment on any aspect of 
this information collection, including (a) Whether the proposed 
collection of information is necessary for FAA's performance; (b) the 
accuracy of the estimated burden; (c) ways for FAA to enhance the 
quality, utility and clarity of the information collection; and (d) 
ways that the burden could be minimized without reducing the quality of 
the collected information. The agency will summarize and/or include 
your comments in the request for OMB's clearance of this information 
collection.
    OMB Control Number: 2120-0601.
    Title: License Requirements for Operation of a Launch Site.
    Form Numbers: There are no FAA forms associated with this 
collection.
    Type of Review: Renewal of an information collection.
    Background: This collection is applicable upon concurrence of 
requests for conducting commercial launch operations as prescribed in 
14 CFR parts 401 et al., Commercial Space Transportation Licensing 
Regulation. A commercial space launch services provider must complete 
the Launch Operators License, Launch-Specific License or Experimental 
Permit to gain authorization for conducting commercial launch 
operations.
    The information will be collected per 14 CFR part 440 appendix A. A 
permit or license applicant is required to provide the FAA information 
to conduct maximum probable loss determination. Also, it is a mandatory 
requirement that all commercial permitted and licensed launch 
applicants obtain financial coverage for claims by a third party for 
bodily injury or property damage. FAA is responsible for determining 
the amount of financial responsibility required using maximum probable 
loss determination. The financial responsibility must be in place and 
active for every launch activity. Applicants' launched activity can 
vary, on average, from once a week to once a year. If there are any 
significant changes to the launch vehicle that potentially could modify 
the results of the financial responsibility determined, the permitted 
and licensed applicant must provide updated information to the FAA. The 
FAA will use the updated collected information and revise the financial 
responsibility results.
    The following is summary of the information required to conduct an 
MPL:
    1. Mission description including: launch trajectory, orbital 
inclination; and orbit altitudes (apogee and perigee).
    2. Flight sequence.
    3. Staging events and the time for each event.
    4. Impact locations.
    5. Identification of the launch site facility, including the launch 
complex on the site, planned date of launch, and launch windows.
    6. Launch vehicle descriptions including: general description of 
the launch vehicle and its stages, including dimensions; description of 
major systems, including safety systems.

[[Page 13654]]

    Description of rocket motors and type of fuel used; and 
identification of all propellants to be used and their hazard 
classification under the hazardous materials.
    7. Payload.
    8. Flight safety system.
    Respondents: Approximately 10 applicants.
    Frequency: Information is collected on occasion.
    Estimated Average Burden per Response: 100 hours.
    Estimated Total Annual Burden: 1,000 hours.
