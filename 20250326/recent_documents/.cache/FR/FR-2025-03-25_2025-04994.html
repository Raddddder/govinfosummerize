    General Description of Collection: The collection implements 
recordkeeping requirements associated with the Bank Protection Act. The 
Bank Protection Act of 1968 (12 U.S.C. 1881-1884) requires each Federal 
supervisory agency to promulgate rules establishing minimum standards 
for security devices and procedures to discourage financial crime and 
to assist in the identification of persons who commit such crimes. To 
avoid the necessity of constantly updating a technology-based 
regulation, the FDIC takes a flexible approach to implementing this 
statute. It requires each insured nonmember bank to designate a 
security officer who will administer a written security program. The 
security program must (1) establish procedures for opening and closing 
for business and for safekeeping valuables; (2) establish procedures 
that will assist in identifying persons committing crimes against the 
bank; (3) provide for initial and periodic training of employees in 
their responsibilities under the security program; and (4) provide for 
selecting, testing, operating and maintaining security devices as 
prescribed in the regulation. In addition, the FDIC requires the 
security officer to report at least annually to the bank's board of 
directors on the effectiveness of the security program. There is no 
change in the method or substance of the collection. The 9,670-hour 
decrease in burden is the result of the elimination of acquiring 
institutions as respondents, revisions to estimates of the time per 
response, as well as a decline in the number of FDIC-supervised 
institutions.
    2. Title: Ombudsman Post-Examination Surveys.
    OMB Number: 3064-0218.
    Form Number: 6600/58; 6600/59.
    Affected Public: FDIC-supervised insured depository institutions.

    General Description of Collection: The purpose of the surveys is to 
gauge bankers' views on the effectiveness and quality of FDIC Safety 
and Soundness and Consumer Compliance examinations, as well as to 
identify ways to improve the examination process. Respondents are asked 
to voluntarily rate the efficiency of the preexamination process; 
examiners' professionalism and understanding of the laws and 
regulations; the examination process; and examination report quality. 
Respondents will also be allowed to provide feedback on any areas for 
improvement and will be given an option to have someone from the FDIC 
Office of the Ombudsman contact the institution confidentially about 
its recent examination or any other matters. There is no change in the 
method or substance of the collection. The 251-hour decrease in burden 
is the result of the reduction in the estimated annual number of 
respondents.

Request for Comment

    Comments are invited on (a) whether the collections of information 
are necessary for the proper performance of the FDIC's functions, 
including whether the information has practical utility; (b) the 
accuracy of the estimates of the

[[Page 13602]]

burden of the information collections, including the validity of the 
methodology and assumptions used; (c) ways to enhance the quality, 
utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and (d) ways 
to minimize the burden of the collections of information on 
respondents, including through the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information technology. All comments will 
become a matter of public record.

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
