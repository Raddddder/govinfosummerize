Commission adopted rules to advance the nationwide transition to Next 
Generation 911 (NG911).\1\ These rules require wireline providers, 
Commercial Mobile Radio Service (CMRS) providers, covered text 
providers, providers of interconnected Voice over Internet Protocol 
(VoIP) services, and providers of internet-based Telecommunications

Authorities. These rules include notification and recordkeeping 
requirements applicable

[[Page 13557]]

to 911 Authorities and OSPs, as described in more detail herein.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The NG911 Report and Order was corrected via two errata 
released on September 5, 2024, and October 1, 2024. The Second 
Erratum was published at 89 FR 83628.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Valid Requests. Under 47 CFR 9.31(a) and (b), 911 Authorities that 
wish to make Phase 1 or Phase 2 valid requests for delivery of 911 
traffic in IP-based formats must provide OSP notification containing 
certain certifications and information via either direct communication 
or a registry to be made available by the Commission.
    OSPs will use the information collected pursuant to Sec.  9.31(a) 
and (b) that is submitted by 911 Authorities to trigger their NG911 
transition requirements described in Sec.  9.29(a) and (b), 
respectively, and their NG911 implementation deadlines set forth in 
Sec.  9.30(a) and (b), respectively. To the extent that 911 Authorities 
use a registry made available by the Commission to submit their valid 
request notifications pursuant to Sec.  9.31(a)(5) and (b)(6), the 
Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau (PSHSB) will use the 
information collected pursuant to Sec.  9.31(a) and (b) to monitor the 
progress of valid requests at each phase of the NG911 transition and to 
keep track of implementation deadlines associated with each valid 
request.
    Petitions. Under 47 CFR 9.31(c), OSPs that wish to challenge 911 
Authorities' valid requests may submit a petition to PSHSB within 60 
days of the receipt of a Phase 1 or 2 request from a 911 Authority. 
Such challenge petitions must meet applicable procedural requirements 
and must be in the form of an affidavit that contains certain 
supporting information. The affected 911 Authority may file an 
opposition to the OSP's petition, and OSPs may file replies to 
oppositions. Filing parties must serve a copy of the document on the 
other party at the time of filing.
    PSHSB will use the information collected pursuant to Sec.  9.31 
that is submitted by the OSPs in their petitions challenging 911 
Authorities' valid requests, as well as information submitted by 911 
Authorities who file oppositions to such petitions and information 
submitted by OSPs who file replies to such oppositions, to determine 
whether to pause the implementation deadline for that OSP, affirm the 
request of the 911 Authority as valid, or take other action as 
necessary. The requirements should simplify the enforcement and 
complaint process for both OSPs and 911 Authorities regarding OSPs' 
implementation deadlines.
    Mutual Agreements. Under 47 CFR 9.34, 911 Authorities and OSPs may 
enter into voluntary mutual agreements that establish terms different 
from the Commission's rules. Within 30 days of the date when any such 
agreement is executed, or subsequently amended, modified, or 
terminated, the participating OSP must notify the Commission and 
provide information about each requirement that is impacted by the 
agreement and how the alternative terms differ from each impacted rule.
    The information collected pursuant to Sec.  9.34(a) and (b) 
provides the Commission with awareness of any changes to the 
requirements of OSPs under the rules.
