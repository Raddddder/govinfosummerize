Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration

[Docket No. PHMSA-2025-0018]


Pipeline Safety: Pipeline Safety Management System

AGENCY: Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), 
Department of Transportation.

ACTION: Notice; issuance of advisory bulletin.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: PHMSA is issuing this advisory bulletin to promote the 
implementation of a pipeline safety management system (PSMS) by 
regulated pipeline owners and operators.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Joseph Yoon by phone at 202-819-1547 
or by email at <a href="mailto:joseph.yoon@dot.gov">joseph.yoon@dot.gov</a>.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: PSMS provides a proactive and systematic 
approach to risk management of complex processes across the pipeline 
organization to operate safely and to improve safety performance. PSMS 
also provides a scalable framework for pipeline operators of varying 
size, scope, and level of PSMS implementation maturity. PHMSA 
encourages pipeline operators to develop and to implement PSMS 
programs, using a framework such as the one detailed in American 
Petroleum Institute (API) Recommended Practice (RP) 1173: Pipeline 
Safety Management Systems (API RP 1173). The framework should define 
the elements for identifying, managing, and reducing risks throughout 
the pipeline life cycle. Issuance of this advisory bulletin is 
consistent with section 205 of the Protecting our Infrastructure of 
Pipelines and Enhancing Safety (PIPES) Act of 2020 (Pub. L. 116-
260),\1\ which directs the Secretary of Transportation (Secretary) to 
``promote'' the implementation of pipeline safety management systems by 
pipeline operators. It also addresses the National Transportation 
Safety Board's (NTSB) Safety Recommendation P-24-002.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ See 49 U.S.C. 60103 note.

I. Background

    A safety management system (SMS) is an organization-wide approach 
to managing safety risk through systematic procedures, practices, and 
policies. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) defines SMS as a 
``formal, top-down, organization-wide approach to managing safety risk 
and assuring the effectiveness of safety risk controls. It includes 
systematic procedures, practices, and policies for the management of 
safety risk.'' \2\ In the pipeline community, SMS is similarly 
described as a ``systematic approach to managing safety, including the 
structures, policies, and procedures an organization uses to direct and 
control its activities.'' \3\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    NTSB has long advocated for PSMS implementation by the pipeline 
industry. After investigating two serious accidents in 2010, NTSB found 
that pipeline safety would be enhanced if pipeline companies 
implemented SMSs. The first accident occurred on July 25, 2010, when a 
30-inch pipeline ruptured in Marshall, Michigan, resulting in the 
estimated release of 840,000 gallons of crude oil into the Kalamazoo 
River. The second accident occurred on September 9, 2010, when a 
natural gas transmission pipeline ruptured in San Bruno, California, 
killing eight people, injuring many more, and destroying 38 homes.

[[Page 13659]]

    NTSB issued Pipeline Accident Report NTSB/PAR-12/01 following its 
investigation of the former accident.\4\ In discussing the benefits of 
applying SMS to pipeline systems, NTSB stated:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ NTSB, PAR-12/01, Enbridge Incorporated Hazardous Liquid 
Pipeline Rupture and Release, Marshall, Michigan, July 25, 2010, 
(July 10, 2012), <a href="https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/PAR1201.pdf">https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/PAR1201.pdf</a>.

    In recent years, several transportation modes have implemented 
SMSs to enhance the safety of their operations, and the NTSB has 
consistently supported these activities. The NTSB has advocated the 
implementation of SMSs in transportation systems by elevating SMSs 
to its Most Wanted List. However, the NTSB has not called for an SMS 
in pipeline operations. This Marshall accident and the 2010 pipeline 
accident in San Bruno, California, indicate that SMSs are needed to 
enhance the safety of pipeline operations.
    Both the San Bruno accident and the Marshall accident involved 
errors at the management and operator levels in both pipeline 
integrity and control center operations. The delays in recognizing 
and responding to the pipeline rupture and the deficiencies in 
control center team performance were prominent aspects of both 
accidents. . . .
    The evidence from this accident and from the San Bruno accident 
indicates that company oversight of pipeline control center 
management and operator performance was deficient. In both cases, 
pipeline ruptures were inadequately identified and delays in 
identifying and responding to the leaks exacerbated the consequences 
of the initial pipeline ruptures.
    Therefore, the NTSB conclude[d] that pipeline safety would be 
enhanced if pipeline companies implemented SMSs.\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ NTSB, PAR-12/01, at 116-117.

    Having reached these conclusions, NTSB issued Safety Recommendation 
P-12-17 advising API to ``facilitate the development of a safety 
management system standard specific to the pipeline industry that is 
similar in scope to [API's] Recommended Practice 750, Management of 
Process Hazards.'' API responded by forming a multi-stakeholder work 
group, including PHMSA representatives, to develop a PSMS recommended 
practice, and that effort ultimately led to the issuance of API RP 1173 
(1st edition) on July 8, 2015.
    In response to API RP 1173, the pipeline industry formed a PSMS 
Industry Team (PSMS Team) to educate stakeholders and to enhance safe 
pipeline operations through the implementation and use of PSMSs.\6\ The 
PSMS Team developed various tools that pipeline operators could use as 
guidelines to assist in planning, developing, and implementing PSMSs. 
Since the issuance of API RP 1173 in 2015, PHMSA, States, various 
industry associations, and other stakeholders have encouraged voluntary 
implementation of PSMS across the pipeline industry. In its 2023 Annual 
Report, the PSMS Team indicated that nearly 85 percent of total 
pipeline industry mileage is covered by PSMS.\7\ Information obtained 
from a 2023 PHMSA voluntary information collection to determine how 
many gas distribution operators are implementing PSMSs indicated that 
about 86 percent of all gas distribution pipeline mileage is operated 
by companies that have begun implementing PSMSs voluntarily.\8\

    In January 2024, NTSB issued Safety Recommendation P-24-002 to 
PHMSA in response to a pipeline release that occurred on October 1, 
2021, in San Pedro Bay in California. In that safety recommendation, 
NTSB advised PHMSA to ``[i]ssue an advisory bulletin to all Pipeline 
and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration-regulated pipeline owners 
and operators, promoting the benefits of pipeline safety management 
systems and asking them to develop and implement such a system based on 
American Petroleum Institute Recommended Practice 1173.'' \9\ NTSB 
stated that ``the implementation of a robust PSMS program would have 
helped'' the operator of the ruptured pipeline ``comply with 
regulations, ensure employees were following company procedures, and 
better prepare personnel to respond and react to the conditions found 
during this release.'' \10\ NTSB concluded that had a PSMS been in 
place, the operator ``may have further evaluated their operations, 
identified continuous improvement opportunities, and better positioned 
their staff to respond and react to a leak.'' \11\

    In July 2024, NTSB issued a Safety Alert, ``Pipeline Safety 
Management Systems: Vital for the Safe Operation of Pipelines.'' \12\ 
In that safety alert, NTSB noted it found that: (1) ``pipeline safety 
would be enhanced if companies implemented [PSMS];'' (2) ``[a]lthough 
PSMS have been adopted by operators representing 85 percent of industry 
pipeline mileage, many operators, particularly smaller operators, have 
not yet adopted PSMS;'' (3) ``[t]he pipeline industry continues to have 
accidents that could have been prevented or the consequences more 
effectively mitigated had risks been more thoroughly identified and 
addressed;'' and (4) ``[w]ithout full commitment from the pipeline 
industry to implement and mature PSMS, pipeline accidents will continue 
to occur and the industry will not be able to meet their goal of zero 
accidents, fatalities, and serious injuries.'' \13\

    NTSB further noted that pipeline operators can: (1) ``[i]mplement a 
robust PSMS as described in API RP 1173. API RP 1173 Pipeline Safety 
Management System requirements provide guidance for operators to 
establish a system to continuously track and improve safety''; (2) 
``[f]or those who have incorporated PSMS into their practices, continue 
to improve operations and training. Pipeline operators with PSMS cannot 
be complacent. One of the hallmarks of a good PSMS is that it 
continuously evolves and improves safety programs''; (3) ``[s]upport 
revisions to API RP 1173 and other guidance as it is developed to 
include small operators and contractors in their efforts to establish a 
PSMS. According to the 2022 Pipeline SMS Annual Report, `Last year also 
featured important initiatives to support small operator and contractor 
implementation of RP 1173 along their journey of continuous improvement 
and the combined vision of One Industry, One Team, One Mission, 
Pipeline Safety' ''; and (4) ``[w]ith a PSMS, operators can ensure 
pipelines are designed, constructed, operated, and maintained in a way 
that complies with more than the minimum safety standards found in 
regulations. Experience has shown that using a PSMS can be effective 
and result in significant reductions of serious pipeline accidents each 
year.'' \14\

    Section 205 of the PIPES Act of 2020 directed the Secretary to 
submit to Congress a report describing the progress of gas distribution 
pipeline operators with respect to implementation of API RP 1173 and 
the feasibility of natural gas distribution

[[Page 13660]]

system operators implementing PSMS based on the size of the operator. 
Section 205 further directed the Secretary and the State authorities 
with a certification in effect to promote and to assess pipeline safety 
management system frameworks developed by operators of natural gas 
distribution systems. PHMSA is delegated with carrying out this 
mandate.
    PHMSA submitted that report to Congress on August 2, 2024. The 
report concluded, among other things, that:

    With respect to [gas distribution] operators whose leadership 
have demonstrated a tangible commitment to implementing a PSMS, 
there is a clear trend for larger operator's PSMS efforts to be 
reported as ``on-track,'' which accounts for roughly two-thirds of 
the largest category of operators. However, more than one-half of 
the smallest category of operators reported that their PSMS efforts 
best fit the ``stalled'' characterization. Based on the data 
[collected by PHMSA from the operators to prepare the report] . . . 
small operators are much less likely to implement a PSMS than large 
operators. . . . Although the API RP 1173 framework is intended to 
be scalable for pipeline operators of varying size and scope, and 
the essential elements of the framework apply to organizations of 
any size or sophistication, it appears that very small operators 
need additional guidance to realize the benefits of implementing a 
PSMS. PHMSA recommend[ed] that the American Gas Association and the 
American Public Gas Association continue to promote the 
implementation of a PSMS and provide guidance to their members, 
particularly the smaller operators to assist them in realizing the 
value of implementing a PSMS program. PHMSA will continue to work 
with its state partners to promote PSMS implementation by all 
operators. PHMSA will also continue participating on API's task 
group reviewing the current API RP 1173 to develop a revision that 
provides additional guidance to smaller operators, enabling them to 
implement a size-scaled PSMS program.\15\

Management Systems by Gas Distribution Pipeline Operators (Aug. 2, 
2024), <a href="https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/news/report-congress-implementation-safety-management-systems-gas-distribution-pipeline-operators">https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/news/report-congress-implementation-safety-management-systems-gas-distribution-pipeline-operators</a>.

    Major pipeline accidents with serious consequences are rare in this 
country; but, when they occur, they are generally because of an 
alignment of weaknesses or failures across multiple activities. To 
manage the safety of complex processes involved in the design, 
installation, operation, and maintenance throughout the life cycle of a 
pipeline, coordinated actions to address multiple dynamic activities 
and circumstances are required. PSMS, coupled with a strong safety 
culture, enables operators to identify and to analyze hazards 
proactively and to manage the associated risks to prevent harm to 
people and the environment, and, ultimately, to reach both PHMSA's and 
the industry's goal of zero incidents.
    PHMSA believes that it is in the best interest of safety that 
operators build and maintain a strong safety culture. A pipeline 
operator's culture comprises, among other things, the everyday 
attitudes, values, norms, and beliefs with respect to risk, safety, and 
environmental protection shared throughout the organization by leaders 
and employees of all levels. Operators can continuously strengthen 
their safety culture by establishing safety as a core value and, more 
importantly, through their everyday actions. Maintaining a strong 
safety culture requires operators to address safety issues proactively, 
and to understand and to address threats against the operator's safety 
culture, such as complacency, fear of reprisal, overconfidence, and 
normalization of deviance. Implementing a well-designed PSMS 
strengthens an operator's safety culture. Each element of PSMS supports 
safety culture and the culture feeds back into PSMS in a continuous 
process. This results in a strong and positive safety culture, an 
increasingly mature PSMS, and enhanced pipeline safety. Building and 
nurturing a strong safety culture helps achieve the best safety 
outcomes. API RP 1173 provides several examples of a positive safety 
culture that should be considered by all operators.\16\

    PHMSA is issuing this advisory bulletin to help promote the 
benefits of PSMS more broadly, and to encourage regulated pipeline 
owners and operators to implement PSMS based on API RP 1173 voluntarily 
as part of their efforts to build and to maintain a strong safety 
culture that improves the safety performance of their systems.\17\

II. Advisory Bulletin (ADB-2025-01)

    To: Owners and Operators of Regulated Pipelines.
    Subject: Pipeline Safety Management System.
    Advisory: PHMSA is issuing this advisory bulletin to promote and to 
encourage regulated pipeline owners and operators in developing and 
implementing a pipeline safety management system (PSMS) based on a 
framework such as the one detailed in the American Petroleum 
Institute's (API) Recommended Practice (RP) 1173: Pipeline Safety 
Management Systems (API RP 1173). This is consistent with section 205 
of the Protecting our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety 
Act of 2020 (Pub. L. 116-260),\18\ which directed the Secretary of 
Transportation to ``promote'' the implementation of pipeline safety 
management systems by pipeline operators, and the National 
Transportation Safety Board's (NTSB) Safety Recommendation P-24-002. 
This advisory bulletin promotes the implementation of PSMSs to improve 
the safety performance of the Nation's pipeline system continually to 
protect the public from the risks associated with pipelines.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \18\ See 49 U.S.C. 60103 note.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The contents of this advisory bulletin do not have the force and 
effect of law. They are not meant to bind operators nor the public in 
any way.
    API RP 1173 provides a PSMS framework that builds upon an 
operator's existing practices with particular emphasis on proactively 
looking for safety gaps, encouraging the non-punitive reporting of 
safety issues, and promptly responding to those issues. API RP 1173 
emphasizes clarifying the safety roles and responsibilities of 
leadership, top management, and employees at all levels throughout the 
operator's organization, including contractor support. PSMS, 
underpinned by a strong safety culture, makes safety programs and 
processes more effective to help prevent pipeline accidents.
    The 10 essential elements of PSMSs outlined in API RP 1173, and the 
principles underlying them, apply to operators of any size and 
complexity. The complexity of a pipeline operator's PSMS program should 
be appropriate for the size of their operations and the risks their 
systems pose to the public and environment.
    PHMSA encourages the voluntary adoption of PSMS based on a 
framework such as the one detailed in API RP 1173, as PHMSA believes 
developing and implementing PSMS would be an effective way to enhance 
pipeline safety systematically. PHMSA shares NTSB's view that a 
voluntarily adopted PSMS program can ensure pipelines are designed, 
constructed, operated, and maintained in a way that complies with

[[Page 13661]]

more than just the minimum safety standards found in regulations.
    For the reasons noted herein, PHMSA strongly encourages regulated 
pipeline owners and operators to take the following actions to 
strengthen their pipeline safety programs:
    <bullet> Implement a PSMS program and ensure that the program 
covers all essential elements of an effective PSMS, such as those in 
API RP 1173.
    <bullet> Ensure the PSMS program continuously evolves and improves.
    <bullet> Maintain a positive safety culture that continually 
promotes diligence throughout the operator's organization and addresses 
issues that can erode the safety culture.

    Issued in Washington, DC, on March 19, 2025, under authority 
delegated in 49 CFR 1.97.
