SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background

    The Division of Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation (LHWC) 
administers the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act. The Act 
provides benefits to workers injured in maritime employment on the 
navigable waters of the United States or in an adjoining area 
customarily used by an employer in loading, unloading, repairing, or 
building a vessel. In addition, several acts extend the Longshore Act's 
coverage to certain other employees.
    Authorized insurance carriers are required to report the issuance 
of policies and endorsements under the Longshore and Harbor Workers' 
Compensation Act and its extensions, the Defense Base Act, Outer 
Continental Shelf Lands Act and Non-Appropriated Fund Instrumentalities 
Act, to the Department of Labor's Office of Workers' Compensation 
Programs (OWCP). 20 CFR 703.116. Carriers use the form LS-570 for this 
purpose. Filing the form LS-570 with OWCP's Division of Federal 
Employees', Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation binds the 
carrier to full liability for the named employer's obligations under 
the Act or its extensions. Legal authority for this information 
collection is found at 33 U.S.C. 932(a) and 33 U.S.C. 939.
    Regulatory authority is found at 20 CFR 703.116 and 20 CFR 703.118.
    This information collection is subject to the PRA. A Federal agency 
generally cannot conduct or sponsor a collection of information, and 
the public is generally not required to respond to an information 
collection, unless the OMB under the PRA approves it and displays a 
currently valid OMB Control Number. In addition, notwithstanding any 
other provisions of law, no person shall generally be subject to 
penalty for failing to comply with a collection of information that 
does not display a valid Control Number. See 5 CFR 1320.5(a) and 
1320.6.

II. Desired Focus of Comments

    OWCP/DLHWC is soliciting comments concerning the proposed 
information collection related to the Request for Employment 
Information. OWCP/DLHWC is particularly interested in comments that:
    <bullet> Evaluate whether the collection of information is 
necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the Agency, 
including whether the information has practical utility;
    <bullet> Evaluate the accuracy of OWCP/C's estimate of the burden 
related to the information collection, including the validity of the 
methodology and assumptions used in the estimate;
    <bullet> Suggest methods to enhance the quality, utility, and 
clarity of the information to be collected; and
    <bullet> Minimize the burden of the information collection on those 
who are to respond, including through the use of appropriate automated, 
electronic, mechanical, or other technological collection techniques or 
other forms of information technology, e.g., permitting electronic 
submission of responses.
    Documents related to this information collection request are 
available at <a href="https://regulations.gov">https://regulations.gov</a> and at DOL-OWCP located at 200 
Constitution Ave. NW, Room S-3323, Washington, DC 20210. Questions
