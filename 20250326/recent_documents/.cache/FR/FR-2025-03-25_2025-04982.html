    On March 22, 2023, the Commission granted Mianyang BOE 
Optoelectronics Technology Co., Ltd.'s (``BOE'') unopposed motion to 
intervene as a respondent in this investigation. Order No. 7 (Mar. 15, 
2023), unreviewed by Comm'n Notice (Mar. 22, 2023).
    Two respondents, Apt-Ability LLC d/b/a MobileSentrix and Mobile 
Defenders, LLC, were terminated based on a consent order. Order No. 43 
(Dec. 20, 2023), unreviewed by Comm'n Notice (Apr. 18, 2024). Ten 
respondents, Captain Mobile Parts, Group Vertical, Sourcely Plus, 
Mengtor, Electronics Universe, LCTech, Parts4Cells, DFW Imports, 
Gadgetfix, and eTech Parts Plus were found in default. Order No. 16 
(May 10, 2023), unreviewed by Comm'n Notice (June 7, 2023); Order No. 
22 (Jun. 27, 2023), unreviewed by Comm'n Notice (July 20, 2023); Order 
No. 25 (Jul. 19, 2023), unreviewed by Comm'n Notice (Aug. 18, 2023); 
Order No. 27 (Aug. 8, 2023), unreviewed by Comm'n Notice (Aug. 30, 
2023). Accordingly, respondents Injured Gadgets, Wholesale Gadget 
Parts, and Phone LCD Parts (collectively, ``the BLF Respondents'') and 
BOE remain active in the investigation.
    On April 20, 2023, the Commission granted SDC's motion for leave to 
amend the complaint and notice of investigation to add allegations of 
infringement related to claims 1-6, 10, 12, 17, 19, 21-23, 40-47, and 
51-52 of the '578 patent. Order No. 8 (Mar. 28, 2023), unreviewed by 
Comm'n Notice (Apr. 20, 2023). When the final ID issued, only claims 5 
and 21 of the '803 patent, claims 5, 10, 17, 40-41, and 47 of the '578 
patent, claims 2-3, 13, and 15-16 of the '599 patent, and claim 6 of 
the '593 patent remain asserted in the investigation as a result of 
termination of all asserted claims of the '683 patent and certain other 
asserted claims. See Order No. 34 (Oct. 26, 2023), unreviewed by Comm'n 
Notice (Nov. 27, 2024), Order No. 39 (Dec. 7, 2023), unreviewed by 
Comm'n Notice (Jan. 8, 2024), Order No. 51 (Jun. 14, 2024), unreviewed 
by Comm'n Notice (Jul. 3, 2024), Order No. 65 (Aug. 27, 2024), 
unreviewed by Comm'n Notice (Sept. 26, 2024).
    On November 15, 2023, the BLF Respondents and BOE (collectively, 
``Respondents'') moved for summary determination that SDC lacked 
standing to bring and maintain this investigation. Respondents argued 
because SDC's parent company, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (``SEC''), 
``has an unfettered right to grant licenses, SDC lacks the exclusionary 
rights necessary to prove standing.'' Mot. at 18. Finding that ``there 
is no genuine issue of material fact that SEC has an unrestricted right 
to sublicense the Asserted Patents to others'' and that SEC's 
possession of such a right divested SDC of exclusionary rights, on 
January 9, 2024, the ALJ granted Respondents' motion for summary 
determination of no violation due to lack of standing. Order No. 44 at 
13, 24-25 (Jan. 9, 2024).
    On April 24, 2024, the Commission vacated that initial 
determination and remanded the investigation for further proceedings 
consistent with its opinion. In its opinion, the Commission found that 
``(1) constitutional standing, the Article III requirements of the 
Constitution related to the authority of federal courts to adjudicate 
lawsuits, is not required at [the] Commission; and (2) there are 
genuine issues of material facts relating to [Complainant's] rights in 
the asserted patents.'' Comm'n Op. at 2. The Commission remanded the 
investigation to the ALJ to ``conduct further proceedings as 
appropriate and consistent with the Commission's opinion herewith.'' 
Id.
    On May 2, 2024, the ALJ held a case management conference to 
discuss how the case would proceed on remand. Respondent BOE indicated 
that it wished to argue that SDC lacked ``all substantial rights'' to 
the asserted patents when it filed its complaint and that it wished to 
pursue discovery from SEC on this issue. Order No. 50 at 3 (June 11, 
2024). SDC responded that a statutory cause of action defense had never 
previously been raised and thus was waived. Id. at 5. OUII noted that 
``Respondents' argument that [SDC] may not have owned the asserted 
patents when it filed the complaint because it did not hold all 
substantial rights is fundamentally different from the argument 
advanced in Respondents' motion for summary determination.'' Id. The 
ALJ then ordered ``additional briefing'' on ``the effect of the 
Commission opinion on th[e] Investigation.'' Order No. 47, EDIS Doc. ID 
820416, at 1 (May 3, 2024). Following a teleconference and briefing on 
remand, the ALJ found that Respondents waived their argument that SDC 
lacked ``all substantial rights'' to the Asserted Patents and thus 
failed to satisfy the requirement of Commission Rule 210.12(a)(7) 
because Respondents did not address this issue in their prehearing 
brief, as required by the ALJ's Ground Rules. ID at 4 (citing Order No. 
50 at 4).
    The evidentiary hearing was held on July 8-9, 2024, and July 15-17, 
2024.
    On November 15, 2024, the ALJ issued a final ID, finding no 
violation of section 337 because SDC failed to show the existence of a 
domestic industry, among other reasons. In particular, the ID found: 
(1) SDC met its burden under Rule 210.12(a)(7); (2) SDC failed to 
satisfy the economic prong of the domestic industry requirement for all 
asserted patents; (3) SDC satisfied the technical prong of the domestic 
industry requirement for the '803, the '578, and the '599 patents but 
not for the '593 patent; (4) at least one representative accused 
product infringes claims 5 and 21 of the '803 patent, claims 5, 10, 17, 
40-41, and 47 of the '578 patent, claims 15-16 of the '599 patent, and 
claim 6 of the '593 patent but not claims 2-3 and 13 of the '599 
patent; and (5) the claims have not been shown to be invalid.
    On November 29, 2024, SDC filed a petition for review of the ID 
challenging certain findings related to the '803, the '578, and the 
'599 patents, including the economic prong of the domestic industry 
requirement. SDC did not petition for review of the ID's findings

[[Page 13626]]

related to the '593 patent. That same day, Respondent BOE and the BLF 
Respondents filed a joint contingent petition for review. OUII did not 
file a petition for review. On December 9, 2024, Complainant, 
Respondents, and OUII each filed a response to the petitions.
    The Commission solicited submissions from the public on the public 
interest issues raised by the recommended determination. 89 FR 92721 
(Nov. 22, 2024). The Commission received comments from Representative 
John Moolenaar, Chairman of the House Select Committee on China, and 
Dr. Robert D. Atkinson of the Information Technology & Innovation 
Foundation.
    On January 8, 2025, SDC filed a notice of supplemental authority to 
apprise the Commission of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board's final 
written decisions in inter partes review proceedings on the '578 patent 
and the '803 patent. In the final written decisions, the Board found 
claim 21 of the '803 patent unpatentable and all other asserted claims 
of the '578 and '803 patents at issue in this investigation had not 
been proven unpatentable. See Mianyang BOE Optoelectronics Tech. Co., 
Ltd. v. Samsung Display Co., Ltd., IPR2023-00987, Final Written 
Decision (Jan. 6, 2025); Mianyang BOE Optoelectronics Tech. Co., Ltd. 
v. Samsung Display Co., Ltd., IPR2023-01075, Final Written Decision 
(Jan. 6, 2025).
    On January 16, 2025, the Commission determined to review the ID in 
part. Specifically, the Commission determined to review: (1) the ID's 
findings that the Commission has statutory authority to investigate 
Complainant SDC's alleged violation under section 337 and that 
Respondents waived their argument that SDC lacked the ability to bring 
this investigation under Commission Rule 210.12; (2) the ID's findings 
related to the technical prong for the '803 patent; and (3) the ID's 
findings regarding the economic prong of the domestic industry 
requirement. 90 FR 8,034-036 (Jan. 23, 2024). The Commission determined 
not to review any other findings presented in the final ID, including 
the ID's finding of no violation of section 337 with respect to the 
'593 patent. The Commission requested briefing from the parties on 
certain issues under review and on remedy, the public interest, and 
bonding. The parties filed their opening written submissions on January 
30, 2025, and their responsive written submissions on February 6, 2025.
    On review, the Commission has found no violation of section 337 
with respect to claims 5 and 21 of the '803 patent; claims 5, 10, 17, 
40-41, and 47 of the '578 patent; and claims 2-3, 13, and 15-16 of the 
'599 patent. Specifically, the Commission has determined to affirm the 
ALJ's finding that the Commission has statutory authority to 
investigate Complainant's alleged violation under section 337. The 
Commission has also determined to affirm the ID's finding that 
representative display panels in the asserted domestic industry 
products practice claim 21 of the '803 patent. The Commission has 
further determined to affirm with modified reasoning the ID's finding 
that Complainant failed to demonstrate the existence of a domestic 
industry under sections 337(a)(3)(A) and (B). Based on this dispositive 
finding, the Commission has determined to take no position on whether 
the asserted domestic industry products also practice claim 5 of the 
'803 patent and whether Respondents forfeited their argument that 
Complainant is not the owner of the Asserted Patents under Commission 
Rule 210.12(a)(7).
    Accordingly, the investigation is terminated with a finding of no 
violation. The Commission's reasoning in support of its determinations 
is set forth more fully in its opinion issued concurrently herewith.
    The Commission vote for this determination took place on March 19, 
2025.
    The authority for the Commission's determination is contained in 
section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1337), and 
in Part 210 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (19 CFR 
part 210).

    By order of the Commission.

    Issued: March 19, 2025.
Lisa Barton,
Secretary to the Commission.
