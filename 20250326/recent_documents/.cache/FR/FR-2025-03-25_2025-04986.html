SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Authority for This Rulemaking

    The FAA's authority to issue rules regarding aviation safety is 
found in Title 49 of the United States Code. Subtitle I, Section 106 
describes the authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII, 
Aviation Programs, describes in more detail the scope of the agency's 
authority. This rulemaking is promulgated under the authority described 
in Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart I, Section 40103. Under that section, 
the FAA is charged with prescribing regulations to assign the use of 
airspace necessary to ensure the safety of aircraft and the efficient 
use of airspace. This regulation is within the scope of that authority, 
as it would amend Class D airspace in Jupiter, FL, for the safety and 
management of instrument flight rules (IFR) operations in the area.

Comments Invited

    The FAA invites interested persons to participate in this 
rulemaking by submitting written comments, data, or views. Comments are 
specifically invited on the overall regulatory, aeronautical, economic, 
environmental, and energy-related aspects of the proposal. The most 
helpful comments reference a specific portion of the proposal, explain 
the reason for any recommended change, and include supporting data; to 
ensure the docket does not contain duplicate comments, commenters 
should submit only one time if comments are filed electronically or 
commenters should send only one copy of written comments if comments 
are filed in writing.
    The FAA will file in the docket all comments it receives, as well 
as a report summarizing each substantive public contact with FAA 
personnel concerning this proposed rulemaking. Before acting on this 
proposal, the FAA will consider all comments it receives on or before 
the closing date for comments. The FAA will consider comments filed 
after the comment period has closed if it is possible to do so without 
incurring expense or delay. The FAA may change this proposal in light 
of the comments it receives.
    Privacy: In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553(c), DOT solicits comments 
from the public to better inform its rulemaking process. DOT posts 
these comments, without editing, including any personal information the 
commenter provides, to <a href="http://www.regulations.gov">www.regulations.gov</a>, as described in the system 
of records notice (DOT/ALL-14 FDMS), which can be reviewed at 
<a href="http://www.dot.gov/privacy">www.dot.gov/privacy</a>.

Availability of Rulemaking Documents

    An electronic copy of this document may be downloaded through the 
internet at <a href="http://www.regulations.gov">www.regulations.gov</a>. Recently published rulemaking 
documents can also be accessed through the FAA's web page at 
<a href="http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/airspace_amendments/">www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/airspace_amendments/</a>.
    You may review the public docket containing the proposal, any 
comments received, and any final disposition in person in the Dockets 
Operations office (see ADDRESSES section for address, phone number, and 
hours of operations). An informal docket may also be examined during 
regular business hours at the office of the Eastern Service Center, 
Federal Aviation Administration, Room 210, 1701 Columbia Ave., College 
Park, GA 30337.

Incorporation by Reference

    Class D is published in paragraph 5000 of FAA Order JO 7400.11, 
Airspace Designations and Reporting Points, which is incorporated by 
reference in 14 CFR 71.1 on an annual basis. This document proposes to 
amend the current version of that order, FAA Order JO 7400.11J, dated 
July 31, 2024, and effective September 15, 2024. FAA Order JO 7400.11J 
is publicly available as listed in the ADDRESSES section of this 
document. These amendments will be published in the next update to FAA 
Order JO 7400.11.
    FAA Order JO 7400.11J lists Class A, B, C, D, and E airspace areas, 
air traffic service routes, and reporting points.

The Proposal

    This action proposes to amend 14 CFR part 71 by amending Class D 
airspace extending upward from the surface to and including 2,500 feet 
MSL within a 4.5-mile radius of William P. Gwinn Airport, beginning at 
the 205[deg] bearing from the airport clockwise to the 145[deg] 
bearing, thence to the beginning point. Controlled airspace is 
necessary for the safety and management of instrument flight rules 
(IFR) operations in the area.

Regulatory Notices and Analyses

    The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an 
established body of technical regulations for which frequent and 
routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. 
It, therefore: (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under 
Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT 
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); 
and (3) does not warrant preparation of a Regulatory Evaluation as the 
anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that 
will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is 
certified that this proposed rule, when promulgated, will not have a 
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities 
under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Environmental Review

    This proposal would be subject to an environmental analysis in 
accordance with FAA Order 1050.1F, ``Environmental Impacts: Policies 
and

[[Page 13573]]

Procedures,'' prior to any FAA final regulatory action.
