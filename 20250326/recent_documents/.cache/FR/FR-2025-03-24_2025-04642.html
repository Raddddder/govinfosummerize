SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Authority for This Rulemaking

    The FAA's authority to issue rules regarding aviation safety is 
found in Title 49 of the United States Code. Subtitle I, Section 106 
describes the authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII, 
Aviation Programs, describes in more detail the scope of the agency's 
authority. This rulemaking is promulgated under the authority described 
in Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart I, Section 40103. Under that section, 
the FAA is charged with prescribing regulations to assign the use of 
airspace necessary to ensure the safety of aircraft and the efficient 
use of airspace. This regulation is within the scope of that authority, 
as it establishes Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above 
the surface at Memorial Hospital Heliport, North Conway, NH.

History

    The FAA published a notice of proposed rulemaking for Docket No. 
FAA 2024-2453 in the Federal Register (90 FR 4679; January 16, 2025), 
proposing to establish Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet 
above the surface for Memorial Hospital Heliport, North Conway, NH. 
Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking 
effort by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No 
comments were received.

Incorporation by Reference

    Class E airspace is published in paragraph 6005 of FAA Order JO 
7400.11, Airspace Designations and Reporting Points, which is 
incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 on an annual basis. This 
document amends the current version of that order, FAA Order JO 
7400.11J, dated July 31, 2024, and effective September 15, 2024. FAA 
Order JO 7400.11J is publicly available as listed in the ADDRESSES 
section of this document. These amendments will be published in the 
next update to FAA Order JO 7400.11. FAA Order JO 7400.11J lists Class 
A, B, C, D, and E airspace areas, air traffic service routes, and 
reporting points.

The Rule

    This amendment to 14 CFR part 71 establishes Class E airspace 
extending upward from 700 feet above the surface within a 6-mile radius 
of the Memorial Hospital Heliport, North Conway, NH. This amendment 
provides the controlled airspace required to support the new RNAV (GPS) 
standard instrument approach procedures for instrument flight rules 
(IFR) operations at the heliport. Controlled airspace is necessary for 
the safety and management of IFR operations in the area.

Regulatory Notices and Analyses

    The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an 
established body of technical regulations for which frequent and 
routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. 
It, therefore: (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under 
Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT 
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); 
and (3) does not warrant preparation of a Regulatory Evaluation as the 
anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that 
will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is 
certified that this rule does not have a significant economic impact on 
a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the 
Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Environmental Review

    The FAA has determined that this action qualifies for categorical 
exclusion under the National Environmental Policy Act in accordance 
with FAA Order 1050.1F, ``Environmental Impacts: Policies and 
Procedures,'' paragraph 5-6.5a. This airspace action is not expected to 
cause any potentially significant environmental impacts, and no 
extraordinary circumstances exist that warrant the preparation of an 
environmental assessment.
