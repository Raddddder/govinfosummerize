[Docket No. 230914-0219; RTID 0648-XE741]


Fisheries of the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico, and South Atlantic; 
2025 Recreational Accountability Measure and Closure for Gag in the 
South Atlantic

AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.

ACTION: Temporary rule; closure.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: NMFS implements an accountability measure (AM) for the 
recreational harvest of gag in South Atlantic Federal waters. NMFS 
reduces the length of the 2025 recreational fishing season for gag to 
prevent landings from exceeding the recreational annual catch limit 
(ACL) as occurred in 2024. Accordingly, NMFS announces the adjusted 
closure date for the recreational harvest of gag in South Atlantic 
Federal waters to protect the gag resource.

DATES: This temporary rule is effective from 12:01 a.m. on June 26, 
2025, through December 31, 2025.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mary Vara, NMFS Southeast Regional 
Office, telephone: 727-824-5305, email: <a href="mailto:mary.vara@noaa.gov">mary.vara@noaa.gov</a>.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The snapper-grouper fishery of the South 
Atlantic includes gag and is managed under the Fishery Management Plan 
for the Snapper-Grouper Fishery of the South Atlantic Region (FMP). The 
FMP was prepared by the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council and 
NMFS, was approved by the Secretary of Commerce, and is implemented by 
NMFS through regulations at 50 CFR part 622 under the authority of the 
Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-
Stevens Act). All weights in this temporary rule are in gutted weight.
    Regulations at 50 CFR 622.193(c)(2) specify the 2025 recreational 
ACL for gag of 176,665 pounds (80,134 kilograms) and the recreational 
AMs. The recreational AM at 50 CFR 622.193(b)(2)(ii) states that if 
recreational landings of gag exceed its ACL, then NMFS will reduce the 
recreational fishing season during the following fishing year to 
prevent recreational landings from again exceeding the recreational 
ACL. NMFS is reducing the length of the 2025 recreational season to 
prevent landings from exceeding the recreational ACL, because this 
condition was met in 2024.
    The recreational season for gag will start on May 1, 2025. Data 
from the NMFS Southeast Fisheries Science Center have informed NMFS' 
projection that recreational landings will reach the recreational ACL 
for 2025 by June 26. Therefore, NMFS announces that the 2025 
recreational season for gag in South Atlantic Federal waters will be 
closed beginning on June 26 and will continue to be closed through 
December 31, 2025. During the recreational closure, the bag and 
possession limits for gag in or from South Atlantic Federal waters are 
zero. The next recreational fishing season for gag begins on May 1, 
2026.

Classification

    NMFS issues this action pursuant to section 305(d) of the Magnuson-
Stevens Act. This action is required by 50 CFR 622.193(c)(2)(ii), which 
was issued pursuant to section 304(b) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, and 
is exempt from review under Executive Order 12866.
    Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), there is good cause to waive prior 
notice and an opportunity for public comment on this action, as notice 
and comment is unnecessary. Such procedure is unnecessary because the 
rule that established the recreational AMs for gag has already been 
subject to public notice and comment, and all that remains is to notify 
the public of the adjusted end date of the recreational season. 
Additionally, providing as much

[[Page 13426]]

advance notice to the public of this shortened fishing season and 
closure allows recreational fishermen, including businesses that 
operate charter vessels and headboats, to prepare for the change to the 
recreational season for gag and to schedule or reschedule their trips.

    Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.

    Dated: March 18, 2025.
Karen H. Abrams,
Acting Director, Office of Sustainable Fisheries, National Marine 
Fisheries Service.
