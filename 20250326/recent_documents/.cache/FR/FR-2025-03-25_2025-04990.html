SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Rationale. On December 13, 2024, pursuant to its statutory duty to 
review and, if appropriate, revise NSPS under section 111(b)(1)(B) of 
the Clean Air Act, the EPA proposed to strengthen the limits for 
emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>) from most new, modified, 
and reconstructed stationary combustion turbines under new subpart 
KKKKa of 40 CFR part 60. In addition, the EPA proposed amendments to 
address specific technical and editorial issues in the current 
regulations for new, modified, and reconstructed stationary combustion 
turbines and stationary gas turbines under 40 CFR part 60, subparts 
KKKK and GG. The EPA received multiple requests for an extension of the 
initial 90-day comment period to allow stakeholders additional time to 
review and comment on the proposed rule. This initial comment period 
ended March 13, 2025. The EPA has decided to reopen the comment period 
for 21 days. The public comment period will now end on April 15, 2025.
    Docket. The EPA has established a docket for this rulemaking under 
Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2024-0419. All documents in the docket are 
listed in <a href="https://www.regulations.gov">https://www.regulations.gov</a>. Although listed in the index, 
some information is not publicly available, e.g., Confidential Business 
Information (CBI) or other information whose disclosure is restricted 
by statute. Certain other material, such as copyrighted material, is 
not placed on the internet and will be publicly available only as pdf 
versions that can only be accessed on the EPA computers in the docket 
office reading room. Certain databases and physical items cannot be

    Instructions. Direct your comments to Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OAR-
2024-0419. The EPA's policy is that all comments received will be

    The <a href="https://www.regulations.gov">https://www.regulations.gov</a> website allows you to submit your

captured and included as part of the comment that is placed in the 
public docket and made available on the internet. If you submit an 
electronic comment, the EPA recommends that you include your name and 
other contact information in the body of your comment and with any 
digital storage media you submit. If the EPA cannot read your comment 
due to technical difficulties and cannot contact you for clarification, 
the EPA may not be able to consider your comment. Electronic files 
should not include special characters or any form of encryption and be 
free of any defects or viruses. For additional information about the
