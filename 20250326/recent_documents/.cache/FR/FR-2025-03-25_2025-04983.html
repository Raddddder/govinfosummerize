Airworthiness Directives; BAE Systems (Operations) Limited 
Airplanes

AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.

ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 
2023-02-06, which applies to all BAE Systems (Operations) Limited Model 
4101 airplanes. AD 2023-02-06 requires revising the existing 
maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or 
more restrictive airworthiness limitations. Since the FAA issued AD 
2023-02-06, the FAA has determined that new or more restrictive 
airworthiness limitations are necessary. This proposed AD would 
continue to require certain actions in AD 2023-02-06 and require 
revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, 
to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. The 
FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these 
products.

Background

    The FAA issued AD 2023-02-06, Amendment 39-22313 (88 FR 7851, 
February 7, 2023) (AD 2023-02-06), for all BAE Systems (Operations) 
Limited Model 4101 airplanes. AD 2023-02-06 was prompted by an MCAI 
originated by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the aviation 
authority for the United Kingdom (UK) (UK CAA). The UK CAA issued AD G-
2022-0006, dated March 30, 2022 (UK CAA AD G-2022-0006), to correct an 
unsafe condition.
    AD 2023-02-06 requires revising the existing maintenance or 
inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more 
restrictive airworthiness limitations. The FAA issued AD 2023-02-06 to 
address fatigue damage of various airplane structures and failure of 
certain structurally significant items, which could result in reduced 
structural integrity of the airplane. The FAA also issued AD 2023-02-06 
to address fuel vapor ignition sources, which could result in a fuel 
tank explosion and consequent loss of the airplane.

Actions Since AD 2023-02-06 Was Issued

    Since the FAA issued AD 2023-02-06, the UK CAA superseded AD G-
2022-0006, and issued UK CAA AD G-2024-0003, dated August 6, 2024; 
corrected August 14, 2024 (UK CAA AD G-2024-0003) (also referred to as 
the MCAI), to correct an unsafe condition on all BAE Systems 
(Operations) Limited Model 4101 airplanes. The MCAI states new or more 
restrictive airworthiness limitations have been developed.
    The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on 
these products.
    You may examine the MCAI in the AD docket at <a href="http://regulations.gov">regulations.gov</a> under 
Docket No. FAA-2025-0339.

Material Incorporated by Reference Under 1 CFR Part 51

    The FAA reviewed Subject 05-10-10, ``Airworthiness Limitations,'' 
of Chapter 05, ``Airworthiness Limitations,'' of BAE Systems 
(Operations) Limited J41 Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM), Revision 
46, dated February 20, 2024. This service information specifies 
airworthiness limitations for life-limited parts and structurally 
significant items.
    This proposed AD would also require Chapter 05, ``Airworthiness 
Limitations,'' of BAE Systems (Operations) Limited J41 Aircraft 
Maintenance Manual (AMM), Effectivity Group 403, Revision 44, dated 
June 15, 2021; and Chapter 05, ``Airworthiness Limitations,'' of BAE 
Systems (Operations) Limited J41 AMM, Effectivity Group 408, Revision 
44, dated June 15, 2021; which the Director of the Federal Register 
approved for incorporation by reference as of March 14, 2023 (88 FR 
7851, February 7, 2023). ``Effectivity Group'' is not specifically 
stated on these documents. However, ``403'' and ``408,'' which are 
stated on the pages of the applicable documents (except for the title 
pages), refer to the effective groups of airplanes specified within the 
fleet code listings.
    This material is reasonably available because the interested 
parties have access to it through their normal course of business or by 
the means identified in the ADDRESSES section.

Other Related Material

    The FAA also reviewed Subject 05-10-20, ``Certification Maintenance 
Requirements,'' of Chapter 05, ``Airworthiness Limitations,'' and 
Subject 05-10-30, ``Critical Design Configuration Control Limitations 
(CDCCL)--Fuel System,'' of Chapter 05, ``Airworthiness Limitations,'' 
of BAE Systems (Operations) Limited J41 Aircraft Maintenance Manual 
(AMM), Revision 45, dated December 15, 2023. This service information 
specifies airworthiness limitations for certification maintenance 
requirements and fuel tank systems, which are specified in appendices A 
and B of this proposed AD.

FAA's Determination

    This product has been approved by the aviation authority of another 
country and is approved for operation in the United States. Pursuant to 
the FAA's bilateral agreement with this State of Design Authority, it 
has notified the FAA of the unsafe condition described in the MCAI and 
material referenced above. The FAA is issuing this NPRM after 
determining that the unsafe condition described previously is likely to 
exist or develop on other products of the same type design.

Proposed Requirements of This NPRM

    This proposed AD would retain certain requirements of AD 2023-02-
06. This proposed AD would also require revising the existing 
maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or 
more restrictive airworthiness limitations.
    This proposed AD would require revisions to certain operator 
maintenance documents to include new actions (e.g., inspections) and 
Critical Design Configuration Control Limitations (CDCCLs). Compliance 
with these actions and CDCCLs is required by 14 CFR 91.403(c). For 
airplanes that have been previously modified, altered, or repaired in 
the areas addressed by this proposed AD, the operator may not be able 
to accomplish the actions described in the revisions. In this 
situation, to comply with 14 CFR 91.403(c), the operator must request 
approval for an alternative method of compliance according to paragraph 
(k)(1) of this proposed AD.

Costs of Compliance

    The FAA estimates that this AD, if adopted as proposed, would 
affect 4 airplanes of U.S. registry. The FAA estimates the following 
costs to comply with this proposed AD:
    The FAA estimates the total cost per operator for the retained 
actions from AD 2023-02-06 to be $7,650 (90 work-hours x $85 per work-
hour).
    The FAA has determined that revising the maintenance or inspection 
program takes an average of 90 work-hours per operator, although the 
agency recognizes that this number may vary from operator to operator. 
Since operators incorporate maintenance or inspection program changes 
for their affected fleet(s), the FAA has determined that a per-operator 
estimate is more accurate than a per-airplane estimate. Therefore, the 
agency estimates the average total cost per operator to be $7,650 (90 
work-hours x $85 per work-hour).
    The FAA estimates the total cost per operator for the new proposed 
actions to be $7,650 (90 work-hours x $85 per work-hour).

Authority for This Rulemaking

    Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to 
issue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the 
authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII: Aviation Programs, 
describes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.
    The FAA is issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in 
Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701: General requirements. 
Under that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight 
of civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for 
practices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary 
for safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that 
authority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to 
exist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action.

Regulatory Findings

    The FAA determined that this proposed AD would not have federalism 
implications under Executive Order 13132. This proposed AD would not 
have a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship 
between the national government and the States, or on the distribution 
of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.
    For the reasons discussed above, I certify this proposed 
regulation:
    (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive 
Order 12866,
    (2) Would not affect intrastate aviation in Alaska, and
    (3) Would not have a significant economic impact, positive or 
negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria 
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
