RIN 0925-AA69


Privacy Act; Implementation; Further Delay of Effective Date

AGENCY: National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and 
Human Services (HHS).

ACTION: Final rule; further delay of effective date.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: On January 16, 2025, the Department of Health and Human 
Services published a final rule to make effective the exemptions that 
were previously proposed for a new Privacy Act system of records, ``NIH 
Police Records,'' maintained by the National Institutes of Health 
(NIH), from certain requirements of the Act. That final rule was 
originally scheduled to take effect on February 18, 2025. Subsequently, 
the effective date was delayed until March 21, 2025, in response to the 
memorandum titled ``Regulatory Freeze Pending Review,'' issued by the 
President on January 20, 2025. This notice further delays the effective 
date until May 5, 2025.

DATES: As of March 21, 2025, the effective date of the final rule 
published on January 16, 2025 (90 FR 4673), delayed until March 21, 
2025 (90 FR 9844), is further delayed until May 5, 2025.

Assessment, National Institutes of Health, 6705 Rockledge Drive, Suite 
601, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, telephone 301-402-6469, email

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On January 16, 2025, HHS issued a final rule 
(90 FR 4673) to make effective the exemptions that were proposed (89 FR 
48536) for a new Privacy Act system of records maintained by NIH from 
certain requirements of the Act. The new system of records covers 
criminal and non-criminal law enforcement investigatory material 
maintained by the NIH Division of Police, a component of NIH which 
performs criminal law enforcement as its principal function. The 
exemptions are necessary and appropriate to protect the integrity of 
law enforcement proceedings and records compiled during the course of 
NIH Division of Police activities, prevent disclosure of investigative 
techniques, and protect the identity of confidential sources involved 
in those activities.
    On January 20, 2025, President Donald J. Trump issued a memorandum 
titled ``Regulatory Freeze Pending Review,'' (90 FR 8249) that 
instructs Federal agencies to consider delaying the effective date of 
rules published in the Federal Register, but which have not yet taken 
effect, for a period of 60 days from the date of the memorandum. In 
accordance with that memorandum, HHS delayed for 60 days from the date 
of the President's memorandum the effective date of the final rule 
titled ``Privacy Act; Implementation'' that published on January 16, 
2025.
    The effective date of that final rule, which would have been March 
21, 2025, is now May 5, 2025.

Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.,
Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services.
