[EPA-R10-OAR-2024-0595; FRL-12391-05-R10]


Air Plan Approval; AK, Fairbanks North Star Borough; 2006 24-Hour 
PM2.5 Serious Area and 189(d) Plan

AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

ACTION: Proposed rule; reopening of comment period.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is reopening the 
public comment period on the proposed rule entitled ``Air Plan 
Approval; AK, Fairbanks North Star Borough; 2006 24-hour 
PM<INF>2.5</INF> Serious Area and 189(d) Plan'' published on January 8, 
2025. Commenters requested more time to review the proposal and prepare 
comments. In response, the EPA is providing an additional 30 days for 
the public to provide comment on all aspects of the proposed rule. The 
January 8, 2025, notice of proposed rulemaking also started the EPA's 
adequacy process for the motor vehicle emissions budgets and began the 
public comment period for that process. The EPA is not reopening the 
public comment period for the adequacy process, and it intends to 
proceed with the adequacy process outside of this rulemaking.

DATES: The comment period for the proposed rule published on January 8, 
2025, at 90 FR 1600, is reopened to allow more time to review the 
proposal and prepare comments. The EPA is reopening the comment period 
and the comments must be received on or before April 23, 2025.

ADDRESSES: Submit your comments, identified by Docket ID No. EPA-R10-
OAR-2024-0595, at <a href="https://www.regulations.gov">https://www.regulations.gov</a>. Follow the online 
instructions for submitting comments. Once submitted, comments cannot 
be edited or removed from <a href="http://Regulations.gov">Regulations.gov</a>. The EPA may publish any 
comment received to its public docket. Do not submit electronically any 
information you consider to be Confidential Business Information (CBI) 
or other information the disclosure of which is restricted by statute. 
Multimedia submissions (audio, video, etc.) must be accompanied by a 
written comment. The written comment is considered the official comment 
and should include discussion of all points you wish to make. The EPA 
will generally not consider comments or comment

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On January 8, 2025, the EPA published a 
notice of proposed rulemaking to approve changes to the Alaska State 
Implementation Plan (90 FR 1600). The changes, submitted by the State 
of Alaska on December 4, 2024, address Clean Air Act requirements for 
the 2006 24-hour fine particulate matter (PM<INF>2.5</INF>) national 
ambient air quality standards in the Fairbanks North Star Borough 
Serious PM<INF>2.5</INF> nonattainment area. Alaska's submission 
includes State Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions to meet 
nonattainment planning requirements for emissions inventories, modeling 
and sulfur dioxide precursor demonstration for major stationary 
sources, control measures, attainment projections and progress to 
attainment and associated motor vehicle emissions budgets, and 
contingency measures. The public comment period closed on February 7, 
2025. Commenters requested more time to review the proposal and prepare 
comments with respect to the energy efficiency and weatherization 
measures discussed in the January 8, 2025, notice of proposed 
rulemaking.\1\ In response to this request, the EPA is reopening the 
public comment period on the proposed rule and providing an additional 
30 days for the public to provide comments on all aspects of the 
proposed rule.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ 90 FR 1600, January 8, 2025, section II.C.3.a.iv.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The January 8, 2025, notice of proposed rulemaking also started the 
transportation conformity adequacy process for the motor vehicle 
emissions budgets in Alaska's submitted SIP. As noted in the proposal, 
the EPA may find budgets adequate before the SIP submission is approved 
in a final rule, once the public has been provided with a comment 
period of at least 30 days. The EPA is not reopening the public comment 
period for the adequacy process, and it intends to proceed with the 
adequacy process outside of this rulemaking, as described in 40 CFR 
93.118(f).
