Previous Request for Comments

    On August 23, 2024, the Commission published a notice and request 
for comment in the Federal Register (89 FR 68159) regarding the 
agency's request for approval from OMB for information collections as 
required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. During the 60-day 
period, the Commission received one comment. That comment was outside 
the scope of the information collection and was not considered.

    Title: 46 CFR part 565--Controlled Carriers.
    OMB Approval Number: 3072-0060 (Expires April 30, 2025).
    Abstract: The Shipping Act requires that the Commission monitor the 
practices of controlled carriers (defined at 46 U.S.C. 40102(9)) to 
ensure that they do not maintain rates or charges in their tariffs and 
service contracts that are below a level that is just and reasonable; 
nor establish, maintain, or enforce unjust or unreasonable 
classifications, rules, or regulations in those tariffs or service 
contracts that result or are likely to result in the carriage or 
handling of cargo at rates or charges that are below a just and 
reasonable level, 46 U.S.C. 40701-40706. Part 565, title 46 of the Code 
of Federal Regulations establishes the method by which the Commission 
determines whether a particular ocean common carrier is a controlled 
carrier subject to 46 U.S.C. 40701-40706. When a government acquires a 
controlling interest in an ocean common carrier, or when a controlled 
carrier newly enters a United States trade, the Commission's rules 
require that such a carrier notify the Commission of these events.
    Current Actions: There are no changes to this information 
collection, and it is being submitted for extension purposes only.
    Type of Review: Extension.
    Needs and Uses: The Commission uses these notifications in order to 
effectively discharge its statutory duty to determine whether a 
particular ocean common carrier is a controlled carrier and therefore 
subject to the requirements of 46 U.S.C. 40701-40706.
    Frequency: The submission of notifications from controlled carriers 
is not assigned to a specific time frame by the Commission; they are 
submitted as circumstances warrant. The Commission only requires 
notification when a majority portion of an ocean common carrier becomes 
owned or controlled by a foreign government, or when a controlled 
carrier newly begins operation in any United States trade.
    Type of Respondents: Controlled carriers are ocean common carriers 
that are, or whose operating assets are, directly or indirectly, owned 
or controlled by a foreign government. The Shipping Act defines 
``controlled carriers'' at 46 U.S.C. 40102(9).
    Number of Annual Respondents: The Commission cannot anticipate when 
a new controlled carrier may enter the United States trade, when 
ownership or control of a carrier will change so that notification is 
required, or when a controlled carrier exits the United States trade. 
Over the past three years, the Commission has received, on average, 
fewer than one notification per year. However, as the Commission has 
recently classified several additional carriers as controlled carriers, 
the total estimated burden is increased.
    Estimated Time per Response: The estimated time for each 
notification is 2 hours.
    Total Annual Burden: For purposes of calculating total annual 
burden, the Commission assumes 12 responses annually. The Commission 
thus estimates the total annual burden to be

24 hours (12 responses x 2 hours per response).

Secretary.
