Disclosure

    Commerce intends to disclose the calculations performed for these 
final results of review to parties to the proceeding within five days 
of the date of publication of this notice in the Federal Register, in 
accordance with 19 CFR 351.224(b).

Assessment Rates

    Pursuant to section 751(a)(2)(C) of the Act, and 19 CFR 
351.212(b)(1), Commerce has determined, and U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection (CBP) shall assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate 
entries of subject merchandise in accordance with these final results 
of review.\7\ We calculated importer-specific ad valorem assessment 
rates for the merchandise by dividing the total amount of antidumping 
duties calculated for all reviewed sales to the importer by the total 
entered value of the merchandise sold to the importer, in accordance 
with 19 CFR 351.212(b)(1). Where an importer-specific ad valorem 
assessment rate is not zero or de minimis, Commerce will instruct CBP 
to collect the appropriate duties at the time of liquidation. Where an 
importer-specific ad valorem assessment rate is zero or de minimis, 
Commerce will instruct CBP to liquidate the appropriate entries without 
regard to antidumping duties.\8\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ See Antidumping Proceeding: Calculation of the Weighted-
Average Dumping Margin and Assessment Rate in Certain Antidumping 
Duty Proceedings; Final Modification, 77 FR 8101 (February 14, 
2012).
    \8\ Id., 77 FR 8101, 8102; see also 19 CFR 351.106(c)(2).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In accordance with Commerce's ``automatic assessment'' practice, 
Commerce will instruct CBP to liquidate POR entries of the subject 
merchandise that Interpipe produced and sold, but did not know it was 
destined for the United States, at the all-others rate (i.e., 23.75 
percent) \9\ if there is no rate for the intermediate company(ies) 
involved in the transaction.\10\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ See Order, 86 FR 47055.
    \10\ See Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Proceedings: 
Assessment of Antidumping Duties, 68 FR 23954 (May 6, 2003).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Commerce intends to issue assessment instructions to CBP no earlier 
than 35 days after the date of publication of this notice in the 
Federal Register. If a timely summons is filed at the U.S. Court of 
International Trade, the assessment instructions will direct CBP not to 
liquidate relevant entries until the time for parties to file a request 
for a statutory injunction has expired (i.e., within 90 days of 
publication).

Cash Deposit Requirements

    The following cash deposit requirements will be effective for all 
shipments of the subject merchandise entered, or withdrawn from 
warehouse, for consumption on or after the publication date of this 
notice in the

[[Page 13452]]

Federal Register, as provided by section 751(a)(2)(C) of the Act: (1) 
the cash deposit rate for Interpipe will be equal to the weighted-
average dumping margin listed in the table above; (2) for companies 
that were previously reviewed or investigated in this proceeding that 
are not listed in the table above, the cash deposit rate will continue 
to be the rate assigned to the company in the most recently completed 
segment of this proceeding in which the company was examined; (3) if 
the exporter of the subject merchandise does not have a company-
specific rate but the producer of the subject merchandise does, then 
the cash deposit rate will be the rate assigned to the producer of the 
subject merchandise in the most recently completed segment of this 
proceeding in which the producer was examined; and (4) the cash deposit 
rate for all other producers or exporters will continue to be the all-
others rate of 23.75 percent that was established in the less-than-
fair-value investigation in this proceeding.\11\ These cash deposit 
requirements, when imposed, shall remain in effect until further 
notice.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \11\ See Order, 84 FR at 47057.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notification to Importers

    This notice serves as a final reminder to importers of their 
responsibility under 19 CFR 351.402(f)(2) to file a certificate 
regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation 
of the relevant entries during this review period. Failure to comply 
with this requirement could result in Commerce's presumption that 
reimbursement of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent 
assessment of double antidumping duties.

Administrative Protective Order (APO)

    This notice serves as the only reminder to parties subject to an 
APO of their responsibility concerning the disposition of proprietary 
information disclosed under APO in accordance with 19 CFR 
351.305(a)(3), which continues to govern business proprietary 
information in this segment of the proceeding. Timely written 
notification of the return or destruction of APO materials or 
conversion to judicial protective order, is hereby requested. Failure 
to comply with the regulations and the terms of an APO is a 
sanctionable violation.

Notification to Interested Parties

    We are issuing and publishing these final results of review in 
accordance with sections 751(a)(1) and 777(i) of the Act, and 19 CFR 
351.221(b)(5).

    Dated: March 17, 2025.

Deputy Assistant Secretary for Policy and Negotiations, performing the 
non-exclusive functions and duties of the Assistant Secretary for 
Enforcement and Compliance.
