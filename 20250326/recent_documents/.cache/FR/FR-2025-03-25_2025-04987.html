SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION


Interest Rates

    The Small Business Administration publishes an interest rate called 
the Optional Peg Rate (13 CFR 120.214) on a quarterly basis. This rate 
is a weighted average cost of money to the Government for maturities 
similar to the average SBA direct loan. This rate may be used as a base 
rate for guaranteed fluctuating interest rate SBA loans. This rate will 
be 4.75 percent for the April-June quarter of fiscal year 2025.
    Pursuant to 13 CFR 120.921(b), the maximum legal interest rate for 
any Third Party Lender's commercial loan which funds any portion of the 
cost of a 504 project (see 13 CFR 120.801) shall be 6% over the New 
York Prime rate or, if that exceeds the maximum interest rate permitted 
by the constitution or laws of a given State, the maximum interest rate 
will be the rate permitted by the constitution or laws of the given 
State.

David Parrish,
Chief, Secondary Market Division.
