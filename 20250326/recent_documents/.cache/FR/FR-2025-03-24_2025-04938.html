SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

The Petitions

    On February 26, 2025, the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) 
received antidumping duty (AD) petitions concerning imports of certain 
chassis and subassemblies thereof (chassis) from Mexico, Thailand, and 
Vietnam filed in proper form on behalf of the U.S. Chassis 
Manufacturers Coalition (the petitioner),\1\ the members of which are 
domestic producers of chassis.\2\ The AD Petitions were accompanied by 
countervailing duty (CVD) petitions concerning imports of chassis from 
Mexico and Thailand.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The members of the U.S. Chassis Manufacturers Coalition are 
Cheetah Chassis Corporation and Stoughton Trailers, LLC.
    \2\ See Petitioner's Letter, ``Petitions for the Imposition of 
Antidumping and Countervailing Duties,'' dated February 26, 2025 
(Petitions).
    \3\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Between February 28 and March 11, 2025, Commerce requested 
supplemental information pertaining to certain aspects of the Petitions 
in supplemental questionnaires.\4\ Between March 4 and 11, 2025, the 
petitioner filed timely responses to these requests for additional 
information.\5\

See Petitioner's Letter, ``Supplement to Exhibit I-13 of Volume I 
General Issues Petition,'' dated February 27, 2025 (Revised Exhibit 
I-13).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In accordance with section 732(b) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as 
amended (the Act), the petitioner alleges that imports of chassis from 
Mexico, Thailand, and Vietnam are being, or are likely to be, sold in 
the United States at less than fair value (LTFV) within the meaning of 
section 731 of the Act, and that imports of such products are 
materially injuring, or threatening material injury to, the chassis 
industry in the United States. Consistent with section 732(b)(1) of the 
Act, the Petitions were accompanied by information reasonably available 
to the petitioner to support its allegations.
    Commerce finds that the petitioner filed the Petitions on behalf of 
the domestic industry because the petitioner is an interested party, as 
defined in section 771(9)(F) of the Act.\6\ Commerce also finds that 
the petitioner demonstrated sufficient industry support for the 
initiation of the requested LTFV investigations.\7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ The members of the petitioning coalition are interested 
parties under section 771(9)(C) of the Act.
    \7\ See section on ``Determination of Industry Support for the 
Petitions,'' infra.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Periods of Investigation

    Because the Petitions were filed on February 26, 2025, pursuant to 
19 CFR 351.204(b)(1), the period of investigation (POI) for the Mexico 
and Thailand LTFV investigations is January 1, 2024, through December 
31, 2024. Because Vietnam is a non-market economy (NME) country, 
pursuant to 19 CFR 351.204(b)(1), the POI for the Vietnam LTFV 
investigation is July 1, 2024, through December 31, 2024.

Scope of the Investigations

    The products covered by these investigations are chassis from 
Mexico, Thailand, and Vietnam. For a full description of the scope of 
these investigations, see the appendix to this notice.

Comments on the Scope of the Investigations

    On February 28 and March 7, 2025, Commerce requested information 
and clarification from the petitioner regarding the proposed scope to 
ensure that the scope language in the Petitions is an accurate 
reflection of the products for which the domestic industry is seeking 
relief.\8\ On March 4 and 10, 2025, the petitioner provided 
clarifications and revised the scope.\9\ The description of merchandise 
covered by these investigations, as described in the appendix to this 
notice, reflects these clarifications.

Supp-4 through I-Supp-6; see also Second General Issues Supplement 
at 1-8 and Exhibits I-Supp2-1 and I-Supp2-2.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As discussed in the Preamble to Commerce's regulations, we are 
setting aside a period for interested parties to raise issues regarding 
product coverage (i.e., scope).\10\ Commerce will consider all scope 
comments received from interested parties and, if necessary, will 
consult with interested parties prior to the issuance of the 
preliminary determinations. If scope comments include factual 
information,\11\ all such factual information should be limited to 
public information. Commerce requests that interested parties provide 
at the beginning of their scope comments a public executive summary for 
each comment or issue raised in their submission. Commerce further 
requests that interested parties limit their public executive summary 
of each comment or issue to no more than 450 words, not

[[Page 13458]]

including citations. Commerce intends to use the public executive 
summaries as the basis of the comment summaries included in the 
analysis of scope comments. To facilitate preparation of its 
questionnaires, Commerce requests that scope comments be submitted by 
5:00 p.m. Eastern Time (ET) on April 7, 2025, which is 20 calendar days 
from the signature date of this notice. Any rebuttal comments, which 
may include factual information, and should also be limited to public 
information, must be filed by 5:00 p.m. ET on April 17, 2025, which is 
10 calendar days from the initial comment deadline.

351.312.
    \11\ See 19 CFR 351.102(b)(21) (defining ``factual 
information'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Commerce requests that any factual information that parties 
consider relevant to the scope of these investigations be submitted 
during that period. However, if a party subsequently finds that 
additional factual information pertaining to the scope of the 
investigations may be relevant, the party must contact Commerce and 
request permission to submit the additional information. All scope 
comments must be filed simultaneously on the records of the concurrent 
LTFV and CVD investigations.

Filing Requirements

    All submissions to Commerce must be filed electronically via 
Enforcement and Compliance's Antidumping Duty and Countervailing Duty 
Centralized Electronic Service System (ACCESS), unless an exception 
applies.\12\ An electronically filed document must be received 
successfully in its entirety by the time and date it is due.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Comments on Product Characteristics

    Commerce is providing interested parties an opportunity to comment 
on the appropriate physical characteristics of chassis to be reported 
in response to Commerce's AD questionnaires. This information will be 
used to identify the key physical characteristics of the subject 
merchandise in order to report the relevant factors of production (FOP) 
or cost of production (COP) accurately, as well as to develop 
appropriate product comparison criteria.
    Interested parties may provide any information or comments that 
they feel are relevant to the development of an accurate list of 
physical characteristics. Specifically, they may provide comments as to 
which characteristics are appropriate to use as: (1) general product 
characteristics; and (2) product comparison criteria. We note that it 
is not always appropriate to use all product characteristics as product 
comparison criteria. We base product comparison criteria on meaningful 
commercial differences among products. In other words, although there 
may be some physical product characteristics utilized by manufacturers 
to describe chassis, it may be that only a select few product 
characteristics take into account commercially meaningful physical 
characteristics. In addition, interested parties may comment on the 
order in which the physical characteristics should be used in matching 
products. Generally, Commerce attempts to list the most important 
physical characteristics first and the least important characteristics 
last.
    In order to consider the suggestions of interested parties in 
developing and issuing the AD questionnaires, all product 
characteristics comments must be filed by 5:00 p.m. ET on April 7, 
2025, which is 20 calendar days from the signature date of this notice. 
Any rebuttal comments must be filed by 5:00 p.m. ET on April 17, 2025, 
which is 10 calendar days from the initial comment deadline. All 
comments and submissions to Commerce must be filed electronically using 
ACCESS, as explained above, on the record of the each of the LTFV 
investigations.

Determination of Industry Support for the Petitions

    Section 732(b)(1) of the Act requires that a petition be filed on 
behalf of the domestic industry. Section 732(c)(4)(A) of the Act 
provides that a petition meets this requirement if the domestic 
producers or workers who support the petition account for: (i) at least 
25 percent of the total production of the domestic like product; and 
(ii) more than 50 percent of the production of the domestic like 
product produced by that portion of the industry expressing support 
for, or opposition to, the petition. Moreover, section 732(c)(4)(D) of 
the Act provides that, if the petition does not establish support of 
domestic producers or workers accounting for more than 50 percent of 
the total production of the domestic like product, Commerce shall: (i) 
poll the industry or rely on other information in order to determine if 
there is support for the petition, as required by subparagraph (A); or 
(ii) determine industry support using a statistically valid sampling 
method to poll the ``industry.''
    Section 771(4)(A) of the Act defines the ``industry'' as the 
producers as a whole of a domestic like product. Thus, to determine 
whether a petition has the requisite industry support, the statute 
directs Commerce to look to producers and workers who produce the 
domestic like product. The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC), 
which is responsible for determining whether ``the domestic industry'' 
has been injured, must also determine what constitutes a domestic like 
product in order to define the industry. While both Commerce and the 
ITC must apply the same statutory definition regarding the domestic 
like product,\13\ they do so for different purposes and pursuant to a 
separate and distinct authority. In addition, Commerce's determination 
is subject to limitations of time and information. Although this may 
result in different definitions of the like product, such differences 
do not render the decision of either agency contrary to law.\14\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \13\ See section 771(10) of the Act.
    \14\ See USEC, Inc. v. United States, 132 F. Supp. 2d 1, 8 (CIT 
2001) (citing Algoma Steel Corp., Ltd. v. United States, 688 F. 
Supp. 639, 644 (CIT 1988), aff'd 865 F.2d 240 (Fed. Cir. 1989)).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Section 771(10) of the Act defines the domestic like product as ``a 
product which is like, or in the absence of like, most similar in 
characteristics and uses with, the article subject to an investigation 
under this title.'' Thus, the reference point from which the domestic 
like product analysis begins is ``the article subject to an 
investigation'' (i.e., the class or kind of merchandise to be 
investigated, which normally will be the scope as defined in the 
petition).
    With regard to the domestic like product, the petitioner does not 
offer a definition of the domestic like product distinct from the scope 
of the investigations.\15\ Based on our analysis of the information 
submitted on the record, we have determined that chassis, as defined in 
the scope, constitute a single domestic like product, and we have 
analyzed industry support in terms of that domestic like product.\16\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \15\ See Petitions at Volume I (pages 22-26 and Exhibits I-3, I-
17, and I-18); see also Third General Issues Supplement at 1-4 and 
Exhibits I-Supp3-1 and I-Supp3-2.
    \16\ For a discussion of the domestic like product analysis as 
applied to these cases and information regarding industry support, 
see Checklists, ``Antidumping Duty Investigation Initiation 
Checklists: Certain Chassis and Subassemblies Thereof from Mexico, 
Thailand, and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam,'' dated 
concurrently with, and hereby adopted by, this notice (Country-
Specific AD Initiation Checklists), at Attachment II, Analysis of 
Industry Support for the Antidumping and Countervailing Duty 
Petitions Covering Certain Chassis and Subassemblies Thereof from 
Mexico, Thailand, and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (Attachment 
II). These checklists are on file electronically via ACCESS.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[Page 13459]]

    In determining whether the petitioner has standing under section 
732(c)(4)(A) of the Act, we considered the industry support data 
contained in the Petitions with reference to the domestic like product 
as defined in the ``Scope of the Investigations,'' in the appendix to 
this notice. To establish industry support, the petitioner provided the 
2024 production of the domestic like product for the supporters of the 
Petitions and compared this to the estimated total production of the 
domestic like product for the entire domestic industry.\17\ We relied 
on data provided by the petitioner for purposes of measuring industry 
support.\18\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \17\ For further discussion, see Attachment II of the Country-
Specific AD Initiation Checklists.
    \18\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Our review of the data provided in the Petitions, the First General 
Issues Supplement, and other information readily available to Commerce 
indicates that the petitioner has established industry support for the 
Petitions.\19\ First, the Petitions established support from domestic 
producers (or workers) accounting for more than 50 percent of the total 
production of the domestic like product and, as such, Commerce is not 
required to take further action in order to evaluate industry support 
(e.g., polling).\20\ Second, the domestic producers (or workers) have 
met the statutory criteria for industry support under section 
732(c)(4)(A)(i) of the Act because the domestic producers (or workers) 
who support the Petitions account for at least 25 percent of the total 
production of the domestic like product.\21\ Finally, the domestic 
producers (or workers) have met the statutory criteria for industry 
support under section 732(c)(4)(A)(ii) of the Act because the domestic 
producers (or workers) who support the Petitions account for more than 
50 percent of the production of the domestic like product produced by 
that portion of the industry expressing support for, or opposition to, 
the Petitions.\22\ Accordingly, Commerce determines that the Petitions 
were filed on behalf of the domestic industry within the meaning of 
section 732(b)(1) of the Act.\23\

Allegations and Evidence of Material Injury and Causation

    The petitioner alleges that the U.S. industry producing the 
domestic like product is being materially injured, or is threatened 
with material injury, by reason of the imports of the subject 
merchandise sold at LTFV. In addition, the petitioner alleges that 
subject imports exceed the negligibility threshold provided for under 
section 771(24)(A) of the Act.\24\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \24\ For further discussion, see Country-Specific AD Initiation 
Checklists at Attachment III, Analysis of Allegations and Evidence 
of Material Injury and Causation for the Antidumping and 
Countervailing Duty Petitions Covering Certain Chassis and 
Subassemblies Thereof from Mexico, Thailand, and the Socialist 
Republic of Vietnam.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The petitioner contends that the industry's injured condition is 
illustrated by a significant increase in the volume of subject imports; 
reduced market share; underselling and price depression and/or 
suppression; lost sales and revenues; declines in domestic producers' 
U.S. shipments, production, and capacity utilization; decline in 
employment variables; adverse impact on financial performance; negative 
impact on the existing development and production efforts of the 
domestic industry; and the magnitude of the alleged dumping 
margins.\25\ We assessed the allegations and supporting evidence 
regarding material injury, threat of material injury, causation, as 
well as negligibility, and we have determined that these allegations 
are properly supported by adequate evidence, and meet the statutory 
requirements for initiation.\26\

Allegations of Sales at LTFV

    The following is a description of the allegations of sales at LTFV 
upon which Commerce based its decision to initiate LTFV investigations 
of imports of chassis from Mexico, Thailand, and Vietnam. The sources 
of data for the deductions and adjustments relating to U.S. price and 
normal value (NV) are discussed in greater detail in the Country-
Specific AD Initiation Checklists.

U.S. Price

    For Mexico and Vietnam, the petitioner based export price (EP) on 
pricing information for chassis produced in each country and sold or 
offered for sale in the U.S. market during the POI.\27\ For Thailand, 
because the petitioner had reason to believe the sale or sales offer 
was made through a U.S. affiliate, the petitioner based constructed 
export price (CEP) on pricing information for chassis produced in 
Thailand and sold or offered for sale in the U.S. market during the 
POI.\28\ For each country, the petitioner made certain adjustments to 
U.S. price to calculate a net ex-factory U.S. price, where 
applicable.\29\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \27\ See Country-Specific AD Initiation Checklists.
    \28\ See Thailand AD Initiation Checklist.
    \29\ See Country-Specific AD Initiation Checklists.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Normal Value <SUP>30</SUP>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \30\ In accordance with section 773(b)(2) of the Act, for the 
Mexico and Thailand LTFV investigations, Commerce will request 
information necessary to calculate the constructed value (CV) and 
COP to determine whether there are reasonable grounds to believe or 
suspect that sales of the foreign like product have been made at 
prices that represent less than the COP of the product.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    For Mexico, the petitioner based NV on home market pricing 
information obtained for chassis produced in and sold or offered for 
sale in Mexico during the POI.\31\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \31\ See Mexico AD Initiation Checklist.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    For Thailand, the petitioner stated that it was unable to obtain 
home market or third-country pricing information for chassis in 
Thailand to use as a basis for NV.\32\ Therefore, for Thailand, the 
petitioner calculated NV based on CV. For further discussion of CV, see 
the section ``Normal Value Based on Constructed Value.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \32\ See Thailand AD Initiation Checklist.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Commerce considers Vietnam to be an NME country.\33\ In accordance 
with section 771(18)(C)(i) of the Act, any determination that a foreign 
country is an NME country shall remain in effect until revoked by 
Commerce. Therefore, we continue to treat Vietnam as an NME country for 
purposes of the initiation of this LTFV investigation. Accordingly, we 
base NV on FOPs valued in a surrogate market economy country in 
accordance with section 773(c) of the Act.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \33\ See, e.g., Raw Honey from the Socialist Republic of 
Vietnam: Final Results of Antidumping Duty Changed Circumstances 
Review, 89 FR 64411 (August 7, 2024), and accompanying NME Analysis 
Memorandum at 5.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The petitioner claims that Indonesia is an appropriate surrogate 
country for Vietnam because it is a market economy that is at a level 
of economic development comparable to that of Vietnam and is a 
significant producer of comparable merchandise.\34\ The petitioner 
provided publicly available information from Indonesia to value all 
FOPs.\35\ Based on the information provided by the petitioner, we 
believe it is appropriate to use Indonesia as a surrogate country for 
Vietnam to value all FOPs for initiation purposes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \34\ See Vietnam AD Initiation Checklist.
    \35\ Id.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[Page 13460]]

    Interested parties will have the opportunity to submit comments 
regarding surrogate country selection and, pursuant to 19 CFR 
351.301(c)(3)(i), will be provided an opportunity to submit publicly 
available information to value FOPs within 30 days before the scheduled 
date of the preliminary determination.

Factors of Production

    Because information regarding the volume of inputs consumed by 
Vietnamese producers/exporters was not reasonably available, the 
petitioner used the production experience and product-specific 
consumption rates of a U.S. producer of chassis as a surrogate to value 
Vietnamese manufacturers' FOPs.\36\ Additionally, for Vietnam, the 
petitioner calculated factory overhead, selling, general, and 
administrative expenses (SG&A), and profit based on the experience of 
an Indonesian producer of comparable merchandise.\37\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \36\ Id.
    \37\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Normal Value Based on Constructed Value

    As noted above for Thailand, the petitioner stated that it was 
unable to obtain home market or third-country prices for chassis to use 
as a basis for NV. Therefore, for Thailand, the petitioner calculated 
NV based on CV.\38\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \38\ See Thailand AD Initiation Checklist.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Pursuant to section 773(e) of the Act, the petitioner calculated CV 
as the sum of the cost of manufacturing, SG&A expenses, financial 
expenses, and profit.\39\ For Thailand, in calculating the cost of 
manufacturing, the petitioner relied on the production experience and 
input consumption rates of a U.S. producer of chassis, valued using 
publicly available information applicable to Thailand.\40\ In 
calculating SG&A expenses, financial expenses, and profit ratios, the 
petitioner relied on the 2024 financial statements of a producer of 
comparable merchandise domiciled in Thailand.\41\

Fair Value Comparisons

    Based on the data provided by the petitioner, there is reason to 
believe that imports Chassis from Mexico, Thailand, and Vietnam are 
being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at LTFV. Based on 
comparisons of EP or CEP to NV in accordance with sections 772 and 773 
of the Act, the estimated dumping margins for chassis from each of the 
countries covered by this initiation are as follows: (1) Mexico--32.37 
percent; (2) Thailand--181.57 percent; (3) and Vietnam--302.52 
percent.\42\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \42\ See Country-Specific AD Initiation Checklists.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Initiation of LTFV Investigations

    Based upon the examination of the Petitions and supplemental 
responses, we find that they meet the requirements of section 732 of 
the Act. Therefore, we are initiating LTFV investigations to determine 
whether imports of chassis from Mexico, Thailand, and Vietnam are 
being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at LTFV. In 
accordance with section 733(b)(1)(A) of the Act and 19 CFR 
351.205(b)(1), unless postponed, we will make our preliminary 
determinations no later than 140 days after the date of these 
initiations.

Respondent Selection

Mexico and Thailand

    In the Petitions, the petitioner identified 13 companies in Mexico 
and three companies in Thailand as producers and/or exporters of 
chassis.\43\ Following standard practice in AD investigations involving 
market economy countries, Commerce would normally select respondents 
based on U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) entry data for 
imports under the appropriate Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United 
States (HTSUS) subheading(s) listed in the ``Scope of the 
Investigations'' in the Appendix. However, for this investigation, the 
main HTSUS subheadings under which the subject merchandise would enter 
(8716.39.0090 and 8716.90.5060) are basket categories under which non-
subject merchandise may also enter. Therefore, instead of relying on 
CBP entry data in selecting respondents, we intend to issue Q&V 
questionnaires to each potential respondent for which there is complete 
address information on the record.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \43\ See Petitions at Volume I (page 17 and Exhibit I-13); see 
also Revised Exhibit I-13; and First General Issues Supplement at 1-
2 and Exhibits I-Supp-1 and I-Supp-17.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Commerce will also post the Q&V questionnaires along with filing 
instructions on Commerce's website at <a href="https://www.trade.gov/ec-adcvd-case-announcements">https://www.trade.gov/ec-adcvd-case-announcements</a>. Exporters/producers of chassis from Mexico and 
Thailand that do not receive Q&V questionnaires may still submit a 
response to the Q&V questionnaire and can obtain a copy of the Q&V 
questionnaire from Commerce's website. Responses to the Q&V 
questionnaire must be submitted by the relevant producers/exporters no 
later than 5:00 p.m. on April 1, 2025, which is two weeks from the

Vietnam

    In the Petitions, the petitioner identified four companies in 
Vietnam as producers and/or exporters of chassis.\44\ Our standard 
practice for respondent selection in AD investigations involving NME 
countries is to select respondents based on Q&V questionnaires in cases 
where Commerce has determined that the number of companies is large, 
and it cannot individually examine each company based upon its 
resources. Therefore, considering the number of producers and/or 
exporters identified in the Petitions, Commerce will solicit Q&V 
information that can serve as a basis for selecting exporters for 
individual examination in the event that Commerce determines that the 
number is large and decides to limit the number of respondents 
individually examined pursuant to section 777A(c)(2) of the Act. 
Because there are four Vietnamese producers and/or exporters identified 
in the Petitions, Commerce has determined that it will issue Q&V 
questionnaires to each potential respondent for which there is complete 
address information on the record.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \44\ See Petitions at Volume I (page 27 and Exhibit I-13); see 
also Revised Exhibit I-13; and First General Issues Supplement at 1 
and Exhibit I-Supp-1.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Commerce will post the Q&V questionnaires along with filing 
instructions on Commerce's website at <a href="https://www.trade.gov/ec-adcvd-case-announcements">https://www.trade.gov/ec-adcvd-case-announcements</a>. Producers/exporters of chassis from Vietnam that do 
not receive Q&V questionnaires may still submit a response to the Q&V 
questionnaire and can obtain a copy of the Q&V questionnaire from 
Commerce's website. Responses to the Q&V questionnaire must be 
submitted by the relevant Vietnamese producers/exporters no later than 
5:00 p.m. ET on April 1, 2025, which is two weeks from the signature 
date of this notice. All Q&V questionnaire responses must be filed 
electronically via ACCESS. An electronically filed document must be 
received successfully, in its entirety, by

ACCESS no later than 5:00 p.m. ET on the deadline noted above.
    Interested parties must submit applications for disclosure under 
APO in accordance with 19 CFR 351.305(b). As stated above, instructions

<a href="https://www.trade.gov/administrative-protective-orders">https://www.trade.gov/administrative-protective-orders</a>.

Separate Rates

    In order to obtain separate rate status in an NME investigation, 
exporters and producers must submit a separate rate application. The 
specific requirements for submitting a separate rate application in an 
NME investigation are outlined in detail in the application itself, 
which is available on Commerce's website at <a href="https://access.trade.gov/Resources/nme/nme-sep-rate.html">https://access.trade.gov/Resources/nme/nme-sep-rate.html</a>. Note that Commerce recently 
promulgated new regulations pertaining to separate rates, including the 
separate rate application deadline and eligibility for separate rate 
status, in 19 CFR 351.108.\45\ Pursuant to 19 CFR 351.108(d)(1), the 
separate rate application will be due 21 days after publication of this 
initiation notice.\46\ Exporters and producers must file a timely 
separate rate application if they want to be considered for individual 
examination. In addition, pursuant to 19 CFR 351.108(e), exporters and 
producers who submit a separate rate application and have been selected 
as mandatory respondents will be eligible for consideration for 
separate rate status only if they fully respond to all parts of 
Commerce's AD questionnaire and participate in the LTFV proceeding as 
mandatory respondents.\47\ Commerce requires that companies from 
Vietnam submit a response both to the Q&V questionnaire and to the 
separate rate application by the respective deadlines to receive 
consideration for separate rate status. Companies not filing a timely 
Q&V questionnaire response will not receive separate rate 
consideration.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use of Combination Rates

    Commerce will calculate combination rates for certain respondents 
that are eligible for a separate rate in an NME investigation. The 
Separate Rates and Combination Rates Bulletin states:

{w{time} hile continuing the practice of assigning separate rates 
only to exporters, all separate rates that {Commerce{time}  will now 
assign in its NME investigation will be specific to those producers 
that supplied the exporter during the period of investigation. Note, 
however, that one rate is calculated for the exporter and all of the 
producers which supplied subject merchandise to it during the period 
of investigation. This practice applies both to mandatory 
respondents receiving an individually calculated separate rate as 
well as the pool of non-investigated firms receiving the {weighted 
average{time}  of the individually calculated rates. This practice 
is referred to as the application of ``combination rates'' because 
such rates apply to specific combinations of exporters and one or 
more producers. The cash-deposit rate assigned to an exporter will 
apply only to merchandise both exported by the firm in question and 
produced by a firm that supplied the exporter during the period of 
investigation.\48\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Distribution of Copies of the Petitions

    In accordance with section 732(b)(3)(A) of the Act and 19 CFR 
351.202(f), a copy of the public version of the Petitions has been 
provided to the governments of Mexico, Thailand, and Vietnam via 
ACCESS. To the extent practicable, we will attempt to provide a copy of 
the public version of the Petitions to each exporter named in the 
Petitions, as provided under 19 CFR 351.203(c)(2).

ITC Notification

    Commerce will notify the ITC of our initiation, as required by 
section 732(d) of the Act.

Preliminary Determinations by the ITC

    The ITC will preliminarily determine, within 45 days after the date 
on which the Petitions were filed, whether there is a reasonable 
indication that imports of chassis from Mexico, Thailand, and/or 
Vietnam are materially injuring, or threatening material injury to, a 
U.S. industry.\49\ A negative ITC determination for any country will 
result in the investigation being terminated with respect to that 
country.\50\ Otherwise, these LTFV investigations will proceed 
according to statutory and regulatory time limits.

Particular Market Situation Allegation

    Section 773(e) of the Act addresses the concept of particular 
market situation (PMS) for purposes of CV, stating that ``if a 
particular market situation exists such that the cost of materials and 
fabrication or other processing of any kind does not accurately reflect 
the cost of production in the ordinary course of trade, the 
administering authority may use another calculation methodology under 
this subtitle or any other calculation methodology.'' When an 
interested party submits a PMS allegation pursuant to section 773(e) of 
the Act (i.e., a cost-based PMS allegation), the submission must be 
filed in accordance with the requirements of 19 CFR 351.416(b), and 
Commerce will respond to such a submission consistent with 19 CFR 
351.301(c)(2)(v). If Commerce finds that a cost-based PMS exists under 
section 773(e) of the Act, then it will modify its dumping calculations 
appropriately.
    Neither section 773(e) of the Act, nor 19 CFR 351.301(c)(2)(v), 
sets a deadline for the submission of cost-based PMS allegations and 
supporting factual information. However, in order to administer section 
773(e) of the Act, Commerce must receive PMS allegations and supporting 
factual information with enough time to consider the submission. Thus, 
should an interested party wish to submit a cost-based PMS allegation 
and supporting new factual information pursuant to section 773(e) of 
the Act, it must do so no later than 20 days after submission of a 
respondent's initial section D questionnaire response.
    We note that a PMS allegation filed pursuant to sections 
773(a)(1)(B)(ii)(III) or 773(a)(1)(C)(iii) of the Act (i.e., a sales-
based PMS allegation) must be filed within 10 days of submission of a 
respondent's initial section B questionnaire response, in accordance 
with 19 CFR 351.301(c)(2)(i) and 19 CFR 351.404(c)(2).

Submission of Factual Information

    Factual information is defined in 19 CFR 351.102(b)(21) as: (i) 
evidence submitted in response to questionnaires; (ii) evidence 
submitted in support of allegations; (iii) publicly available 
information to value factors under 19 CFR 351.408(c) or to measure the 
adequacy of remuneration under 19 CFR 351.511(a)(2); (iv) evidence 
placed on the record by Commerce; and (v) evidence other than factual 
information described in (i)-(iv). Section 351.301(b) of Commerce's 
regulations requires any party, when submitting factual information, to 
specify under which subsection of 19 CFR 351.102(b)(21) the information 
is being submitted \51\ and, if the information is submitted to rebut, 
clarify, or correct factual information already on the record, to 
provide an explanation identifying the information already on the 
record that the factual information seeks to rebut, clarify, or

[[Page 13462]]

correct.\52\ Time limits for the submission of factual information are 
addressed in 19 CFR 351.301, which provides specific time limits based 
on the type of factual information being submitted. Interested parties 
should review the regulations prior to submitting factual information 
in these investigations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \51\ See 19 CFR 351.301(b).
    \52\ See 19 CFR 351.301(b)(2).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Time Limits for Submission of Factual Information in Response to 
Questionnaires

    Section 351.301(c) of Commerce's regulations states that during a 
proceeding, Commerce may issue to any person questionnaires, which 
includes both and initial and supplemental questionnaires. For all 
investigations initiated after January 15, 2025, the following time 
limits apply: \53\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \53\ See 19 CFR 351.301(c)(1)(i)-(v).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (i) Initial questionnaire responses are due 30 days from the date 
of receipt of such questionnaire. The time limit for response to 
individual sections of the questionnaire, if Commerce requests a 
separate response to such sections, may be less than the 30 days 
allotted for response to the full questionnaire. In general, the date 
of receipt will be considered to be seven days from the date on which 
the initial questionnaire was transmitted.
    (ii) Supplemental questionnaire responses are due on the date 
specified by Commerce.
    (iii) A notification by an interested party, under section 
782(c)(1) of the Act, of difficulties in submitting information in 
response to a questionnaire issued by Commerce is to be submitted in 
writing within 14 days after the date of the questionnaire or, if the 
questionnaire is due in 14 days or less, within the time specified by 
Commerce.
    (iv) A respondent interested party may request in writing that 
Commerce conduct a questionnaire presentation. Commerce may conduct a 
questionnaire presentation if Commerce notifies the government of the 
affected country and that government does not object.
    (v) Factual information submitted to rebut, clarify, or correct 
questionnaire responses. Within 14 days after an initial questionnaire 
response and within 10 days after a supplemental questionnaire response 
has been filed with Commerce, an interested party other than the 
original submitter is permitted one opportunity to submit factual 
information to rebut, clarify, or correct factual information contained 
in the questionnaire response. Within seven days of the filing of such 
rebuttal, clarification, or correction to a questionnaire response, the 
original submitter of the questionnaire response is permitted one 
opportunity to submit factual information to rebut, clarify, or correct 
factual information submitted in the interested party's rebuttal, 
clarification or correction. Commerce will reject any untimely filed 
rebuttal, clarification, or correction submission and provide, to the 
extent practicable, written notice stating the reasons for rejection. 
If insufficient time remains before the due date for the final 
determination or final results of review, Commerce may specify shorter 
deadlines under this section.

Extensions of Time Limits

    Parties may request an extension of time limits before the 
expiration of a time limit established under 19 CFR 351.301, or as 
otherwise specified by Commerce. In general, an extension request will 
be considered untimely if it is filed after the expiration of the time 
limit established under 19 CFR 351.301, or as otherwise specified by 
Commerce.\54\ For submissions that are due from multiple parties 
simultaneously, an extension request will be considered untimely if it 
is filed after 10:00 a.m. ET on the due date. Under certain 
circumstances, Commerce may elect to specify a different time limit by 
which extension requests will be considered untimely for submissions 
which are due from multiple parties simultaneously. In such a case, we 
will inform parties in a letter or memorandum of the deadline 
(including a specified time) by which extension requests must be filed 
to be considered timely. An extension request must be made in a 
separate, standalone submission; under limited circumstances we will 
grant untimely filed requests for the extension of time limits, where 
we determine, based on 19 CFR 351.302, that extraordinary circumstances 
exist. Parties should review Commerce's regulations concerning the 
extension of time limits and the Time Limits Final Rule prior to 
submitting factual information in these investigations.\55\

Appendix

Scope of the Investigations

    The merchandise covered by these investigations consists of 
chassis and subassemblies thereof, whether finished or unfinished, 
whether assembled or unassembled, whether coated or uncoated, 
regardless of the number of axles, for carriage of containers, or 
other payloads (including self-supporting payloads) for road, marine 
roll-on/roll-off (RORO) and/or rail transport. Chassis are 
typically, but are not limited to, rectangular framed trailers with 
a suspension and axle system, wheels and tires, brakes, a lighting 
and electrical system, a coupling for towing behind a truck tractor, 
and a locking system or systems to secure the shipping container or 
containers to the chassis using twistlocks, slide pins or similar 
attachment devices to engage the corner fittings on the container or 
other payload.
    Subject merchandise includes, but is not limited to, the 
following subassemblies:
    <bullet> Chassis frames, or sections of chassis frames, 
including kingpin assemblies, bolsters consisting of transverse 
beams with locking or support mechanisms, goosenecks, drop 
assemblies, extension mechanisms and/or rear impact guards;
    <bullet> Running gear assemblies or axle assemblies for 
connection to the chassis frame, whether fixed in nature or capable 
of

[[Page 13463]]

sliding fore and aft or lifting up and lowering down, which may or 
may not include suspension(s) (mechanical or pneumatic), wheel end 
components, slack adjusters, dressed axles, brake chambers, locking 
pins, and tires and wheels; and
    <bullet> Assemblies that connect to the chassis frame or a 
section of the chassis frame, such as but not limited to, pintle 
hooks or B-trains (which include a fifth wheel), which are capable 
of connecting a chassis to a converter dolly or another chassis.
    Importation of any of these subassemblies, whether assembled or 
unassembled, constitutes an unfinished chassis for purposes of these 
investigations.
    Subject merchandise also includes chassis, whether finished or 
unfinished, entered with components such as, but not limited to: hub 
and drum assemblies, brake assemblies (either drum or disc), bare 
axles, brake chambers, suspensions and suspension components, wheel 
end components, landing gear legs, spoke or disc wheels, tires, 
brake control systems, electrical harnesses and lighting systems.
    Processing of finished and unfinished chassis and components 
such as trimming, cutting, grinding, notching, punching, drilling, 
painting, coating, staining, finishing, assembly, or any other 
processing either in the country of manufacture of the in-scope 
product or in a third country does not remove the product from the 
scope. Inclusion of other components not identified as comprising 
the finished or unfinished chassis does not remove the product from 
the scope.
    Individual components entered and sold by themselves are not 
subject to the investigations, but components entered with a 
finished or unfinished chassis are subject merchandise. A finished 
chassis is ultimately comprised of several different types of 
subassemblies. Within each subassembly there are numerous components 
that comprise a given subassembly.
    This scope excludes dry van trailers, refrigerated van trailers 
and flatbed trailers. Dry van trailers are trailers with a wholly 
enclosed cargo space comprised of fixed sides, nose, floor and roof, 
with articulated panels (doors) across the rear and occasionally at 
selected places on the sides, with the cargo space being permanently 
incorporated in the trailer itself. Refrigerated van trailers are 
trailers with a wholly enclosed cargo space comprised of fixed 
sides, nose, floor and roof, with articulated panels (doors) across 
the rear and occasionally at selected places on the sides, with the 
cargo space being permanently incorporated in the trailer and being 
insulated, possessing specific thermal properties intended for use 
with self-contained refrigeration systems. Flatbed (or platform) 
trailers consist of load carrying main frames and a solid, flat or 
stepped loading deck or floor permanently incorporated with and 
supported by frame rails and cross members.
    The finished and unfinished chassis subject to these 
investigations are typically classified in the Harmonized Tariff 
Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) at subheadings: 8716.39.0090 
and 8716.90.5060. Imports of finished and unfinished chassis may 
also enter under HTSUS subheading 8716.90.5010. While the HTSUS 
subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes, the 
written description of the merchandise under investigation is 
dispositive.
