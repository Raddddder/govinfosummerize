    General Description of Collection: This information collection 
involves the submission of various forms by (1) contractors who wish to 
do business with the FDIC or are currently under contract with the 
FDIC, (2) those vendors and parties participating in innovation pilot 
programs and prize competitions with the possibility of being awarded a 
contract, and (3) government agencies or commercial businesses that 
provide FDIC with past performance information. The Federal Deposit 
Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1819) empowers the FDIC to enter into 
contracts using private sector contractors to provide goods or 
services. Many of these contracts are in service to mission essential 
functions, including resolutions. The Act also provides that the FDIC 
may promulgate policies and procedures to administer the powers granted 
to it, including the power to enter into contracts. Pursuant to such 
policies, the Acquisition and Corporate Services Branch of the FDIC's 
Division of Administration has developed forms and clauses to 
facilitate the procurement of goods and services from private sector 
contractors. The information collected through these forms and clauses 
fall under the definition of collection of information under the 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA). There is no change in the 
methodology or substance of this information collection. The decrease 
in total estimated annual burden from 21,234 hours in 2022 to 13,326 
hours currently is due to the deletion of the former IC associated with 
Form 1600/10.

    General Description of Collection: The Government Securities Act of 
1986 requires all financial institutions acting as government 
securities brokers and dealers to notify their Federal regulatory 
agencies of their broker dealer activities, unless exempted from the 
notice requirements by Treasury Department regulation. The Form G-FIN 
and Form G-FINW are used by insured State nonmember banks that are 
government securities brokers or dealers to notify the FDIC of their 
status or that they have ceased to function as a government securities 
broker or dealer. The Form G-FIN-4 is used by associated persons of 
insured State nonmember banks that are government securities brokers or 
dealers to provide certain information to the bank and to the FDIC 
concerning employment, residence, and statutory disqualification. The 
Form G-FIN-5 is used by insured State nonmember banks that are 
government securities brokers or dealers to notify the FDIC that an 
associated person is no longer associated with the government 
securities broker or dealer function of the bank. There is no change in 
the method or substance of the collection. The overall decrease in 
burden hours is driven both by the decrease in the estimated annual 
number of responses and the changes to the estimated time per response.
    3. Title: Activities and Investments of Insured Depository 
Institutions.
    OMB Number: 3064-0111.
    Form Number: None.
    Affected Public: Insured State nonmember banks and insured State 
savings associations.

    General Description of Collection: Section 24 of the Federal 
Deposit Insurance (FDI Act), 12 U.S.C. 1831a, limits investments and 
other activities in which State banks may engage, as principal, to 
those permissible for national banks and those approved by the FDIC 
under procedures set forth in 12 CFR part 362 of the FDIC's Rules and 
Regulations. With certain exceptions, section 24 of the FDI Act limits 
the activities and investments of State banks to those activities and 
investments that are permissible for national banks. In addition, the 
statute prohibits a State bank from directly engaging, as a principal, 
in any activity or investment that is not permissible for a national 
bank, or indirectly through a subsidiary in an activity or investment 
that is not permissible for a subsidiary of a national bank, unless 
such bank meets its minimum capital requirements and the FDIC 
determines that the activity or investment does not pose a significant 
risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF). The FDIC can make such a 
determination for exception by regulation or by order. Section 28(a), 
12 U.S.C. 1831e, similarly limits the investments and activities of 
State savings associations and their service corporations to those 
permitted by Federal savings associations and their service 
corporations, absent FDIC approval. Part 362 details the activities 
that State banks or their subsidiaries may engage in, under certain 
criteria and conditions and identifies the information that State banks 
must furnish to the FDIC in order to obtain the FDIC's approval or non-
objection. Part 362 also applies to the activities and investments of 
State savings associations and their subsidiaries. There is no change 
in the method or substance of the collection. The increase in burden 
hours from 232 hours in 2022 to 280 hours currently is the result of 
increasing the number of respondents and the number of responses per 
respondent to account for economic fluctuation.
    4. Title: Privacy of Consumer Financial Information.

    General Description of Collection: The elements of this collection 
are required under sections 503 and 504 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, 
15 U.S.C. 6803, 6804. The collection mandates notice requirements and 
restrictions on a financial institution's ability to disclose nonpublic 
personal information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties. 
There is no change in the method or substance of the collection. The 
overall decrease in burden hours is the result of economic fluctuation. 
In particular, the determination that regulation P has de minimis 
burden on consumers to opt out.

    General Description of Collection: This information collection 
implements the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act 
of 2008 (SAFE Act) requirement that employees of federally-regulated 
institutions who engage in the business of a mortgage loan originator 
to register with the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry 
and establishes national licensing and registration requirements. It 
also directs federally-regulated institutions to have written policies 
and procedures in place to ensure that their employees who perform 
mortgage loan originations comply with the registration and other SAFE 
Act requirements. There is no change in the method or substance of the 
collection. The overall decrease in burden hours is the result of 
decreases in both the estimated number of FDIC-supervised institutions 
engaged in mortgage lending as well as the estimated number of mortgage 
loan originators employed at such institutions.
