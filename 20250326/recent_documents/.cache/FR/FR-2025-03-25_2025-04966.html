    l. The proposed Nash Mill Project consists of the following 
existing facilities: (1) a 57-foot-long, 9-foot-high, concrete gravity 
dam topped with 3-foot-high collapsible wooden flashboards with a crest 
elevation of 1,133.41 feet North American Vertical Datum 1988 (NAVD 88) 
at the top of the flashboards; (2) a 2-acre impoundment; (3) an intake 
structure on the north side of the dam equipped with a 10-foot-high by 
10-foot-wide trash rack with 1-inch clear bar spacing; (4) a 4-foot-
diameter, 1,525-foot-long, round steel penstock that trifurcates into 
two 2-foot-diameter penstocks and one 4-foot-diameter pipe; (5) a 31-
foot-long by 18-foot-wide powerhouse that contains two vertical-shaft, 
fixed propeller turbine-generator units and one horizontal-shaft 
turbine-generator unit for a total installed capacity of 225 kilowatts; 
(6) a 600-foot-long tailrace; (7) a 1,800-foot-long bypassed reach; (8) 
a 0.48 kilovolt (kV), 75 kilo-volt-ampere transformer; (9) a 1,830-
foot-long, 12.5-kV transmission line; and (10) appurtenant facilities.
    Marlow Hydro currently operates the project in a run-of-river mode. 
The current license requires Marlow Hydro to release a continuous 
minimum flow of 23 cubic feet per second (cfs) from the project as 
measured downstream of the powerhouse, with a continuous flow of 5.2 
cfs over the dam. From 2016 to 2020, average annual generation of the 
Nash Mill Project was 552 megawatt-hours.

    Marlow Hydro proposes to continue operating the project in a run-
of-river mode and would increase the bypass flow from 5.2 cfs to 14.5 
cfs.

    o. Scoping Process: Pursuant to the National Environmental Policy 
Act (NEPA), Commission staff intends to prepare either an environmental 
assessment (EA) or an environmental impact statement (EIS) 
(collectively referred to as the ``NEPA document'') that describes and 
evaluates the probable effects, including an assessment of the site-
specific and cumulative effects, if any, of the proposed action and 
alternatives. The Commission's scoping process will help determine the 
required level of analysis and satisfy the NEPA scoping requirements, 
irrespective of whether the Commission issues an EA or an EIS. At this 
time, we do not anticipate holding an on-site scoping meeting. Instead, 
we are soliciting written comments and suggestions on the preliminary 
list of issues and alternatives to be addressed in the NEPA document, 
as described in scoping document 1 (SD1), issued March 18, 2025. Copies 
of the SD1 outlining the subject areas to be addressed in the NEPA 
document were distributed to the parties on the Commission's mailing 
list and the applicant's distribution list. Copies of the SD1 may be 
viewed on the web at <a href="http://www.ferc.gov">http://www.ferc.gov</a> using the ``eLibrary'' link. 
Enter the docket number excluding the last three digits in the docket 
number field to access the document (see item m above).

    Dated: March 18, 2025.
Carlos D. Clay,
Deputy Secretary.
