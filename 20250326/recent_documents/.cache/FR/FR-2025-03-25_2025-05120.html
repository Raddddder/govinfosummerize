DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY


Finding of Mass Influx of Aliens

    On January 23, 2025, the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security 
issued a Finding of Mass Influx of Aliens. This finding went into 
effect immediately (on January 23, 2025) and remained in effect for 60 
days (until March 23, 2025). The Acting Secretary's finding published 
in the Federal Register on January 29, 2025. See 90 FR 8,399. Upon 
review of the current situation at the border, I am extending that 
finding.
    The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), at 8 U.S.C. 1103(a), 
provides an expansive grant of authority, stating that in the event of 
a mass influx of aliens off the coast of the United States or a land 
border, the Secretary may authorize a State or local law enforcement 
officer, with the consent of the officer's superiors, to perform duties 
of immigration officers under the INA. In turn, section 65.83 of Title 
28 of the Code of Federal Regulations allows the Secretary \1\ to 
``request assistance from a State or local government in the 
administration of the immigration laws of the United States'' under 
certain specified circumstances. Among those circumstances are when 
``[t]he [Secretary] determines that there exist circumstances involving 
the administration of the immigration laws of the United States that 
endanger the lives, property, safety, or welfare of the residents of a 
State or locality.'' 28 CFR 65.83(b).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Although the regulations reference the ``Attorney General,'' 
Congress has, since the publication of these regulations, 
transferred the authority and responsibility for administering and 
enforcing the immigration laws to the Secretary of Homeland 
Security. See Homeland Security Act of 2002 471, 6 U.S.C. 291 
(abolishing the former Immigration and Naturalization Service); id. 
S 441, 6 U.S.C. 251 (transferring immigration enforcement functions 
from the Department of Justice to the Department of Homeland 
Security); Immigration and Nationality Act 103(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. 
1103(a)(1) (``the Secretary of Homeland Security shall be charged 
with the administration and enforcement of this chapter and all 
other laws relating to the immigration and naturalization of 
aliens.'')
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In making such a determination, the Secretary may also determine 
that there is an ``immigration emergency.'' The regulations define an 
immigration emergency as ``an actual or imminent mass influx of aliens 
which either is of such magnitude or exhibits such other 
characteristics that effective administration of the immigration laws 
of the United States is beyond the existing capabilities of [the 
Department of Homeland Security (DHS)] in the affected area or areas.'' 
28 CFR 65.83(d)(1) (using identical language as 8 U.S.C. 1103(a)(10)).
    Such a determination is based on ``the factors set forth in the 
definitions contained in'' 28 CFR 65.81. Characteristics of an influx 
of aliens, other than magnitude, which may be considered in determining 
whether an immigration emergency exists include: the likelihood of 
continued growth in the magnitude of the influx; an apparent connection 
between the influx and increases in criminal activity; the actual or 
imminent imposition of unusual and overwhelming demands on law 
enforcement agencies; and other similar characteristics.
    Upon review of the current data, I have determined that there 
continues to exist circumstances involving the administration of the 
immigration laws of the United States that endanger the lives, 
property, safety, or welfare of the residents of all 50 States and that 
an actual or imminent mass influx of aliens is arriving at the southern 
border of the United States and presents urgent circumstances requiring 
a continued federal response. I make this finding for the reasons 
discussed below.
    First, over the last four years, our southern border has been 
overrun. As noted in Proclamation 10,888, Guaranteeing the States 
Protection Against Invasion, ``[o]ver the last 4 years, at least 8 
million illegal aliens were encountered along the southern border of 
the United States, and countless millions more evaded detection and 
illegally entered the United States.'').
    Second, as of March 12, 2025, DHS estimates that there are likely 
approximately 20,000 aliens across the Southwest border waiting to 
illegally enter. While encounters along the southwest border declined 
in February 2025, historical trends over the past four years strongly 
indicate that without this finding, aliens are likely to resume 
crossing the border, and border crossing numbers are likely to rise 
again before DHS can gain operational control. It is precisely 
measures, such as this one, that have kept the numbers under control.
    Third, as stated in the January 23, 2025 notice, when border 
crossing numbers are high, much detention capacity is required of U.S. 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Mandatory detention of 
aliens apprehended at the border serves important public safety and 
national security purposes. Aliens who have not completed this process 
have not been effectively vetted for criminality or national security 
threats. Current databases do not allow for comprehensive and rapid 
searching for foreign convictions or other public safety and national 
security risks. As a result, the fact that the numbers at the border 
are effectively forcing DHS to engage in catch-and-release practices is 
eliminating or thwarting legally mandated screenings and it is 
threatening public safety and national security. This does not account 
for so-called gotaways, of which there have been millions over the last 
four years, who are not screened in any manner. Without controls in 
place at the border to stem the influx, DHS loses its capacity to hold 
all aliens as required by the INA. 8 U.S.C. 1225(b). As of March 13, 
2025, ICE has a detention population of 47,372, with a maximum capacity 
of 54,500. ICE's facilities are currently at nearly at 87% occupancy, 
and ICE's priority for detention space is removing aliens with criminal 
records, public safety risks, and national security risks. Should this 
finding not be extended, ICE would be hampered in this critical effort.
    Fourth, an influx of aliens presents significant concerns with 
respect to increased criminal activity. Between FY 2017 and 2019, ICE 
removed 485,930 aliens with criminal convictions or pending criminal 
charges. However, between FY 2021 and FY 2023, ICE removed 158,931 
aliens with criminal convictions or pending criminal charges. Assuming 
that the crime rate of foreign nationals has remained unchanged over 
the year, this 67% decrease (in removals) suggests that tens of 
thousands of criminal aliens remain in the United States. Where there 
is an increase in criminal aliens, there is

[[Page 13623]]

likely to be an increase in criminal activity.
    Furthermore, there is still significant criminality present at the 
Southwest border even though encounter numbers are lower than 
previously. In February 2025, U.S. Customs and Border Protection's 
(CBP's) Office of Field Operations (OFO) and U.S. Border Patrol (USBP) 
encountered 393 criminal aliens. OFO made 645 criminal arrests, and 
USBP had 12 gang apprehensions. USBP referred 169 smuggling events for 
prosecution, and OFO referred 110 events for criminal prosecution. 
Officers and agents seized 14,534.99 pounds of illicit narcotics, 
including 589.81 pounds of deadly fentanyl. Officers and agents also 
seized 104 firearms and 13,822 rounds of ammunition, as well as 
$1,535,228,67 in currency. These numbers are only likely to increase if 
encounter numbers increase.
    Fifth, when border crossing numbers are high, unusual and 
overwhelming demands are imposed on law enforcement officers and 
agencies. There is significant danger presented to officers and agents. 
For example, in February 2025, CBP records indicate that 30 CBP 
officers/agents were assaulted. In February 2025, ICE records indicated 
that aliens assaulted or used force against 10 ICE Enforcement and 
Removal Operations officers. Even while encounter numbers were lower 
than average in February 2025, officers and agents at the border have 
consistent threats against them, and there are too many assaults and 
use of force incidents on officers and agents.
    Additionally, there is a strain on ICE resources, which takes ICE 
away from its mission to preserve national security and public safety. 
ICE has many aliens pending removal that entered during prior influxes 
at the Southwest border. Managing those removals requires a significant 
expenditure of ICE resources. As of November 24, 2024, there were 
1,445,549 aliens on ICE's non-detained docket with final orders of 
removal. This number will only increase should this finding not be 
extended.
    Since January 20, 2025, ICE has arrested 32,809 aliens and removed 
29,033 aliens. The 32,809 arrests include 14,111 that were convicted 
criminals and 9,980 with pending criminal charges. 1,155 of these 
aliens were criminal gang members while another 39 were known or 
suspected terrorists. ICE currently has allocated 7,282 ERO Officers 
but approximately 1,295 positions, or nearly 18%, are currently vacant. 
The ability of ICE to properly enforce immigration laws and focus on 
public safety risks will be greatly hampered should this finding not be 
extended and the previous influx of aliens resumes unabated.
    On the basis of the above facts, I find that these circumstances 
endanger the lives, property, safety, and welfare of the residents of 
every State in the Union. The only way to effectively prevent this 
danger to the States is to maintain operational control of the border, 
which Congress defined to mean ``the prevention of all unlawful entries 
into the United States, including entries by terrorists, other unlawful 
aliens, instruments of terrorism, narcotics, and other contraband.'' 
Secure Fence Act of 2006, Public Law 109-367, 2, 120 Stat. 2638 (2006); 
8 U.S.C. 1701 note; see also id. (stating that the Secretary of DHS 
``shall take all actions the Secretary determines necessary and 
appropriate to achieve and maintain operational control over the entire 
international land and maritime borders of the United States''). I also 
find that there is currently an influx of aliens arriving across our 
entire southern border, which requires a federal response.
    Accordingly, pursuant to the authorities under the INA, 8 U.S.C. 
1101, et seq., including the implementing regulations identified above, 
I find ``that there exist circumstances involving the administration of 
the immigration laws of the United States that endanger the lives, 
property, safety, or welfare of the residents'' of all 50 States. I 
further find that an actual or imminent mass influx of aliens is 
arriving at the southern border of the United States and presents 
urgent circumstances requiring an immediate federal response. I 
therefore request the assistance of State and local governments in all 
50 States.
    The finding is effective immediately and expires in 180 days. This 
finding may expire sooner in the event I find that circumstances have 
changed. Such a finding would be published in the Federal Register.

Kristi Noem,
Secretary of Homeland Security.
