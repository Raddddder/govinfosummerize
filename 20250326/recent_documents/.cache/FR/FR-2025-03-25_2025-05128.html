DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY


Termination of Parole Processes for Cubans, Haitians, 
Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans

ACTION: Notice.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Department of Homeland Security (``DHS'') is terminating 
the categorical parole programs for inadmissible aliens from Cuba, 
Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela and their immediate family members 
(hereinafter referred to as ``CHNV parole programs'') that DHS 
announced in 2022 and 2023. This Federal Register notice is intended to 
provide context and guidance to the public regarding the termination of 
the CHNV parole programs and related employment authorization.

DATES: DHS is terminating the CHNV parole programs as of March 25, 
2025. The temporary parole period of aliens in the United States under 
the CHNV parole programs and whose parole has not already expired by 
April 24, 2025 will terminate on that date unless the Secretary makes 
an individual determination to the contrary. Parolees without a lawful 
basis to remain in the United States following this termination of the 
CHNV parole programs must depart the United States before their parole 
termination date.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

I. Background

    Over the previous two years, DHS has implemented programs through 
which inadmissible aliens who are citizens or nationals of designated 
countries, and their immediate family members, could request 
authorization to travel to the United States in order to be considered 
for parole into the country.\1\ Under these categorical parole 
programs, potentially eligible beneficiaries were adjudicated on a 
case-by-case basis, for advance authorization to travel to a U.S. port 
of entry (``POE'') in the interior of the country to seek a 
discretionary grant of parole.

(Jan. 9, 2023); Implementation of a Change to the Parole Process for 
Cubans, 88 FR 26329 (Apr. 28, 2023); Implementation of a Parole 
Process for Haitians, 88 FR 1243 (Jan. 9, 2023); Implementation of a 
Change to the Parole Process for Haitians, 88 FR 26327 (Apr. 28,

Venezuelans, 87 FR 63507 (Oct. 19, 2022); Implementation of Changes 
to the Parole Process for Venezuelans, 88 FR 1279 (Jan. 9, 2023).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    On January 20, 2025, President Trump issued Executive Order 14165, 
``Securing Our Borders.'' \2\ Section 2 of the Order establishes a 
policy of the United States to take all appropriate action to secure 
the borders of our Nation through a range of means, including deterring 
and preventing the entry of illegal aliens into the United States, and 
removing promptly all aliens who enter or remain in violation of 
Federal law. Section 7 of the Order directs the Secretary of Homeland 
Security to, consistent with applicable law, take all appropriate 
action to ``[t]erminate all categorical parole programs that are 
contrary to the policies of the United States established in [the 
President's] Executive Orders, including the program known as the 
`Processes for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans.' ''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ See Executive Order 14165, Securing Our Borders, 90 FR 8467 
(Jan. 20, 2025) (published Jan. 30, 2025).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Consistent with the President's direction, and for the independent 
reasons stated in this notice, this notice terminates the CHNV parole 
programs. Although DHS established the categorical programs for each 
country through a separate notice in the Federal Register, the 
justification for the establishment of each of the four categorical 
programs was very similar,\3\ and the rationale for termination is 
largely consistent for all four parole programs. Thus, DHS is 
announcing the termination of all four parole programs by publishing 
this single notice in the Federal Register.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(setting out the justifications for the parole programs for 
Nicaragua and Haiti, respectively).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

II. DHS Parole Authority

    The Immigration and Nationality Act (``INA'') confers upon the 
Secretary of Homeland Security (``Secretary'') the narrow discretionary 
authority to parole inadmissible aliens into the United States 
``temporarily under such conditions as [DHS] may prescribe only on a 
case-by-case basis for urgent

[[Page 13612]]

humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit.'' See INA 
212(d)(5)(A), 8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5)(A); see also 8 CFR 212.5(a) and (c) 
through (e) (discretionary authority for establishing conditions of 
parole and for terminating parole). Additionally, upon a finding by DHS 
that the purpose of the temporary, discretionary parole has been 
served, the alien is required to depart the United States ``or be 
returned to the custody from which he was paroled and thereafter his 
case shall continue to be dealt with in the same manner as that of any 
other applicant for admission to the United States.'' INA 212(d)(5)(A), 
8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5)(A).
    A review of the history of the parole authority supports the 
contention that discretionary parole determinations were intended by 
Congress to be narrowly tailored to specific instances and not based on 
a set of broadly applicable eligibility criteria.\4\ Under the law, the 
determination to parole an alien into the country should only be made 
on a case-by-case basis, taking into account each alien's unique 
circumstances. The ultimate determination whether to parole an alien 
into the United States upon the alien's arrival at a POE is made by 
U.S. Customs and Border Protection (``CBP'') officers. See 8 CFR 
212.5(a).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ Parole was codified into immigration law in the Immigration 
and Nationality Act of 1952. As envisioned then, the 1952 Act 
authorized the Attorney General to parole aliens temporarily under 
such conditions as he may prescribe for emergent reasons or reasons 
deemed strictly in the public interest. As expressed then, ``the 
parole of aliens seeking admission is simply a device through which 
needless confinement is avoided while administrative proceedings are 
conducted.'' See Leng May Ma v. Barber, 357 U.S. 185, 190 (1958). 
However, the parole authority, whether intended to be narrow or 
broad, has in fact been used in an increasingly broad manner since 
its inception, often earning the criticism of Congress, which in 
1996 wrote, ``[i]n recent years, however, parole has been used 
increasingly to admit entire categories of aliens who do not qualify 
for admission under any other category in immigration law, with the 
intent that they will remain permanently in the United States. This 
contravenes the intent of section 212(d)(5), but also illustrates 
why further, specific limitations on the Attorney General's 
discretion are necessary.'' See H.R. Rep. 104-469, pt. 1, at 140 
(1996). Furthermore, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigration 
Responsibility Act of 1996 (``IIRIRA'') struck from INA 
212(d)(5)(A), 8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5)(A), the phrase, ``for emergent 
reasons or for reasons deemed strictly in the public interest'' as 
grounds for granting parole into the United States and inserted 
``only on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or 
significant public benefit.'' See Public Law 104-208, div. C, Sec.  
602(a). ``The legislative history indicates that this change was 
animated by concern that parole under 8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5)(A) was 
being used by the executive to circumvent congressionally 
established immigration policy.'' Cruz-Miguel v. Holder, 650 F.3d 
189, 199 n.15 (2d Cir. 2011).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Parole is inherently temporary, and parole alone is not an 
underlying basis for obtaining any immigration status, nor does it 
constitute an admission to the United States. See INA 101(a)(13)(B), 
212(d)(5)(A), 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(13)(B), 1182(d)(5)(A). Once an alien is 
paroled into the United States, the parole allows the alien to stay 
temporarily in the United States for the duration of the parole period 
unless and until the parole expires or is otherwise terminated. See 8 
CFR 212.5(e).
    Paroled aliens, including those paroled under the CHNV parole 
programs, may apply for any immigration benefit or status for which 
they may be eligible, including discretionary employment authorization 
under the (c)(11) employment eligibility category. See 8 CFR 
274a.12(c)(11). In the absence of any subsequent application conferring 
an immigration benefit or status, and upon termination of parole, such 
alien will remain an arriving alien. See 8 CFR 1.2; see also INA 
101(a)(13)(B), 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(13)(B).

III. Rationale for Initial Implementation

    When DHS established the CHNV parole programs, DHS provided several 
justifications for their promulgation. See, e.g., 88 FR at 1248-51 
(Implementation of a Parole Process for Haitians). Overall, DHS stated 
that the programs would provide a significant public benefit for the 
United States and address the urgent humanitarian reasons underlying 
the high levels of migration from those countries.
    With respect to the significant public benefit, DHS wrote that the 
CHNV parole programs would: (i) enhance border security by reducing 
illegal immigration between the POEs, (ii) minimize the domestic impact 
of high levels of illegal immigration by CHNV nationals, particularly 
in border communities; (iii) improve vetting for national security and 
public safety; (iv) reduce the strain on DHS personnel and resources; 
(v) disincentivize a dangerous journey that puts migrant lives and 
safety at risk and enriches smuggling networks; and (vi) fulfill 
important foreign policy goals to manage migration collaboratively in 
the hemisphere.
    For the reasons discussed below, DHS has determined that it is now 
appropriate and necessary to terminate the CHNV parole programs. These 
programs do not serve a significant public benefit, are not necessary 
to reduce levels of illegal immigration, did not sufficiently mitigate 
the domestic effects of illegal immigration, are not serving their 
intended purposes, and are inconsistent with the Administration's 
foreign policy goals.\5\ Regarding previous arguments or determinations 
that these programs were consistent with the requirement of ``urgent 
humanitarian reasons'' for granting parole, DHS believes that 
consideration of any urgent humanitarian reasons for granting parole is 
best addressed on a case-by-case basis consistent with the statute, and 
taking into consideration each alien's specific circumstances. These 
reasons, independently and cumulatively, support termination of the 
CHNV parole programs.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ See INA 212(d)(5)(A), 8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5)(A) (``. . . when 
the purposes of such parole shall, in the opinion the Secretary of 
Homeland Security, have been served the alien shall forthwith return 
or be returned to the custody from which he was paroled.'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Accordingly, the Secretary, in her discretion, is terminating the 
CHNV parole programs. Consistent with her statutory authority, the 
Secretary retains discretion to continue to extend parole to any alien 
paroled under CHNV--temporarily under such conditions as she may 
prescribe only on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons 
or significant public benefit. See INA 212(d)(5)(A), 8 U.S.C. 
1182(d)(5)(A). The decision to do so, or not do so, is committed to the 
Secretary's sole discretion.

1. The CHNV Parole Programs Are Unnecessary To Achieve Border Security 
Goals

    From the announcement of the parole program for Venezuelans and 
their immediate family members on October 12, 2022, through the 
subsequent addition of the programs for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, 
and their immediate family members in January 2023, and until January 
22, 2025, approximately 532,000 inadmissible aliens were granted 
advance authorization to travel to the United States and receive 
consideration for parole into the United States.\6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ Office of Homeland Security Statistics (``OHSS'') analysis 
of advanced travel authorizations data provided by CBP Passenger 
Systems Program Directorate and valid as of January 22, 2025. 
Beneficiary travel authorizations excluded expired applications. The 
Venezuelan program started on October 18, 2022, and the Cuba, Haiti, 
Nicaragua parole programs started January 6, 2023.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    One justification for these 532,000 discretionary paroles was to 
``enhance border security'' at the southwest border of the United 
States.\7\ DHS reasoned that by ``incentivizing individuals to seek a 
lawful, orderly means of traveling to the United States, while imposing

[[Page 13613]]

consequences to irregular migration, . . . the new parole process will 
mitigate anticipated future surges'' of illegal immigration. See, e.g., 
88 FR at 1249 (Implementation of a Parole Process for Haitians). DHS 
pointed to past experience with rapidly increasing ``encounters of 
Guatemalan and Honduran nationals from January 2021 until August 2021'' 
along the southwest border, explaining that the resumption of 
repatriation flights to Guatemala and Honduras helped reduce the amount 
of illegal immigration but was insufficient to address the sheer 
numbers.\8\ Accordingly, the CHNV parole programs contemplated 
enhancing border security by combining ``a consequence for [nationals 
seeking] to enter the United States [in an unlawful manner between POEs 
(i.e., removal or return to a third country, such as Mexico), while 
introducing] an incentive to use [a] lawful process to request 
authorization to travel by air to and enter the United States, without 
making the dangerous journey to the border.'' \9\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ See, e.g., 88 FR at 1255 (``The [Nicaraguan] parole process 
is intended to enhance border security by reducing the record levels 
of Nicaraguan nationals entering the United States between POEs.'').
    \8\ See, e.g., 87 FR at 63509.
    \9\ See, e.g., 87 FR at 63510.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Upon review, DHS concludes that this ``deterrent'' and 
``incentive'' approach did not result in a sufficient and sustained 
improvement in border security, and has exacerbated challenges 
associated with interior enforcement of the immigration laws. 
Encounters of CHNV nationals, particularly at POEs, remained 
unacceptably high while the CHNV parole programs were in effect, and 
overall migration of CHNV nationals to the United States increased 
between October 12, 2022 and January 22, 2025. In addition, the CHNV 
parole programs have at best traded an unmanageable population of 
unlawful migration along the southwest border for the additional 
complication of a substantial population of aliens in the interior of 
the United States without a clear path to a durable status.
    As an initial matter, DHS acknowledges that in establishing the 
CHNV parole programs, and in subsequent DHS evaluations of these 
programs, DHS focused, in part, on a goal of reducing encounters of 
CHNV nationals between POEs.\10\ And it is true that there was a 
reduction in encounters of CHNV nationals between POEs from FY 2022 
through FY 2024--from around 600,000 encounters in FY 2022 to 416,000 
in FY 2023 and 183,000 in FY 2024.\11\ But in implementing the CHNV 
parole programs, DHS also focused on the importance of reducing 
pressures at the southwest border generally. It was for this reason 
that the CHNV parole programs required, for instance, that CHNV 
nationals ``fly at their own expense to an interior [POE] rather than 
entering at a land POE'' \12\ and rendered ineligible those CHNV 
nationals who irregularly entered the United States, Mexico, or Panama 
after the programs' announcement.\13\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \10\ See, e.g., 87 FR at 63507 (``The parole process is intended 
to enhance border security by reducing the record levels of 
Venezuelan nationals entering the United States between POEs, while 
also providing a process for certain such nationals to lawfully 
enter the United States in a safe and orderly manner.''); see also 
Circumvention of Lawful Pathways 88 FR 31314, 31317 (May 16, 2023) 
(noting that in the first weeks following implementation of the CHNV 
parole programs, encounters of CHNV nationals between POEs dropped 
significantly).
    \11\ OHSS analysis of January 2025 OHSS Persist Dataset.
    \12\ See, e.g., 87 FR at 63507; see also id. at 63512 
(explaining that by ``diverting flows of Venezuelan nationals to 
interior POEs through a safe and orderly process,'' DHS could 
relieve pressure on border communities).
    \13\ See, e.g., 87 FR at 63515.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Consistent with that focus and in light of the reality that DHS's 
border security mission involves activities at southwest border POEs as 
well, DHS has concluded that the present assessment of the efficacy of 
the CHNV parole programs should include encounters at such land POEs. 
If one includes encounters of CHNV nationals at POEs, the actual 
reduction in southwest border encounters of CHNV nationals is much more 
muted: encounters of CHNV nationals at and between southwest border 
POEs dropped from approximately 626,000 in FY 2022 only to 584,000 in 
FY 2023 and to 535,000 in FY 2024.\14\ This is due to a significant 
increase in encounters of such aliens at southwest border POEs over 
that time period: from 26,250 in FY 2022 to 168,010 in FY 2023 and 
352,790 in FY 2024.\15\ The increase can be attributed to the use of 
the CBP One mobile application (``CBP One app'' or ``CBP One'') to 
schedule appointments at southwest border POEs,\16\ which resulted in 
very high numbers of CHNV nationals placed into removal proceedings 
pursuant to section 240 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1229a, (``section 240 
removal proceedings'') and released into U.S. border communities,\17\ 
exacerbating the immigration court backlog and the poor incentives that 
the backlog creates.\18\ Finally, it is important to emphasize that in 
addition to these southwest border encounters, DHS must also consider 
the 532,000 parolees who entered the United States under the CHNV 
parole programs.

    \15\ OHSS analysis of January 2025 OHSS Persist Dataset.
    \16\ Section 7 of Executive Order 14165 also directed the 
Secretary to, consistent with applicable law, take all appropriate 
action to cease using the CBP One app. as a method of paroling or 
facilitating the entry of otherwise inadmissible aliens into the 
United States. DHS has ceased the use of the CBP One app for this 
purpose. See CBP, Press Release, CBP Removes Scheduling 
Functionality in CBP One<SUP>TM</SUP> App (Jan. 21, 2025), <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/national-media-release/cbp-removes-scheduling-functionality-cbp-one-app">https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/national-media-release/cbp-removes-scheduling-functionality-cbp-one-app</a> (last updated Jan. 22, 2025).
    \17\ A total of 582,800 CHNV nationals with CBP One registration 
numbers were encountered at southwest border POEs from Jan. 1, 2023-
Jan. 31, 2025, including 576,900 (99 percent) that were issued NTAs. 
OHSS analysis of January 2025 OHSS Persist Dataset.
    \18\ See, e.g., Securing the Border, 89 FR 81156, 81181 (Oct. 7, 
2024) (explaining that particularly in light of the immigration 
court backlog, ``releasing individuals who may otherwise be referred 
for expedited removal may inadvertently incentivize increased 
irregular migration and the exploitation of the asylum system, 
especially by human smugglers who encourage migrants to claim fear 
once they are encountered by USBP as it will allow them to remain in 
the United States for years pending resolution of their case and, 
where appropriate, removal.'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The decision to terminate the discretionary and temporary parole 
programs is further informed by the actions of the prior 
administration, which found the CHNV parole programs, even when paired 
with the Circumvention of Lawful Pathways rule, to be insufficient to 
address very high levels of illegal immigration.\19\ For example, DHS 
and the Department of Justice (DOJ) promulgated the Securing the Border 
framework \20\ as an emergency measure to address ongoing high levels 
of unlawful immigration between southwest border POEs.\21\ The 
Departments explained that ``at the current levels of encounters and 
with current resources, [DHS] cannot predictably and swiftly deliver 
consequences to most noncitizens who cross the border without a lawful 
basis to remain . . . [DHS's] ability to refer and process noncitizens 
through expedited removal thus continues to be overwhelmed, creating a 
vicious cycle.'' \22\ This conclusion--that DHS's ability to swiftly 
impose consequences for illegal immigration ``continue[d] to be 
overwhelmed'' \23\--followed nearly two years of the CHNV parole 
programs, whose chief justification had been facilitating operational 
control of the

[[Page 13614]]

southwest border of the United States. Promulgation of the Securing the 
Border interim final rule in June 2024 reflected the reality that the 
CHNV parole programs and Circumvention of Lawful Pathways rule did not 
sufficiently enhance border security.\24\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \19\ 88 FR 31314 (May 16, 2023).
    \20\ See 89 FR 48710 (June 7, 2024) (interim final rule); 89 FR 
81156 (Oct. 7, 2024) (final rule).
    \21\ ``On June 3, 2024, the President signed Proclamation 10773 
under sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the INA, finding that because 
border security and immigration systems of the United States were 
unduly strained, the entry into the United States of certain 
categories of [aliens] was detrimental to the interests of the 
United States, and suspending and limiting the entry of such 
[aliens].'' See 89 FR at 81157-58.
    \22\ 89 FR at 48714.
    \23\ 89 FR at 48715.
    \24\ DHS notes that on October 4, 2024, the prior administration 
announced that there would be no ``re-parole'' beyond the initial 
two-year period for the parolees who entered the United States under 
the CHNV parole programs. The decision of the prior administration 
to decline renewal or extension of the CHNV related parole coincided 
in large part with other actions of DHS to promulgate policies to 
reduce illegal immigration.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Finally, to whatever extent the CHNV parole programs could be 
characterized as reducing encounters of CHNV nationals at the southwest 
border from the very high levels that existed in late 2022, DHS does 
not believe that the programs are necessary to achieve such reductions 
at this time. In December 2022--the last full month prior to 
implementation of all four programs--the U.S. Border Patrol (USBP) 
encountered around 84,000 CHNV nationals at the southwest border.\25\ 
That figure has been below 12,000 every month since January 2024, and 
below 6,000 every month since June 2024, when DHS and DOJ issued the 
Securing the Border rule.\26\ In January 2025, even with the CHNV 
parole programs paused, USBP encountered around 3,400 CHNV nationals at 
the southwest border.\27\ Whatever the need for these programs may have 
been in late 2022, the situation at the southwest border now, and the 
set of tools implemented by DHS to deter illegal immigration, are quite 
different.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Moreover, with the implementation of President Trump's policies 
beginning on January 20, 2025, border encounters generally have 
continued to drop notwithstanding the ongoing pause on these programs. 
Southwest border encounters between POEs fell from an average of about 
1,180 aliens per day in the two-week period ending on January 20, 2025, 
to an average of about 640 per day in the two-week period from January 
21 to February 3, 2025, and fell further to an average just under 260 
per day in the two-week period from February 12, 2025 to February 25, 
2025.\28\ Over those same three time periods, southwest border releases 
from USBP custody fell from an average of about 240 per day to an 
average of about 50 per day and then an average of fewer than 5 per 
day.\29\

DHS also notes that to whatever extent the incentives created by the 
parole programs for Cubans and Haitians deterred illegal immigration 
by sea--a particularly dangerous form of migration--the parole 
programs are not necessary for such deterrence and raise other 
issues, some of which are outlined in sections III.2-4 of this 
notice. DHS has adopted a more robust enforcement posture in 
general, and will monitor trends in maritime migration and respond 
as appropriate. Through early February 2025, DHS has yet to see a 
return to the very high levels of maritime migration observed in 
2022.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The need to break the ``vicious cycle'' of unlawful immigration 
supports this DHS action to terminate the CHNV parole programs in favor 
of new presidential directives that address the demand for enhanced 
border security beyond the 2024 Securing the Border framework.\30\ 
Executive Order 14165, ``Securing Our Borders,'' \31\ and Executive 
Order 14159, ``Protecting the American People Against Invasion,'' \32\ 
exemplify more reasoned and realistic initiatives to control unlawful 
immigration at the southwest border of the United States.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \30\ The streamlined procedures offered by the Securing the 
Border framework and complementary actions permitted DHS to more 
than triple the percentage of aliens processed for expedited removal 
under INA 235(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(1), and decrease the number of 
aliens released by USBP pending immigration court proceedings by 89 
percent, a number that has only improved further with the end of 
``catch and release.'' Encounters and releases based on OHSS

2. The Domestic Effects of Illegal Immigration Continued To Be Felt 
Throughout Implementation of the CHNV Parole Programs

    Although one goal of the CHNV parole programs was to ``help 
minimize the burden on communities, state and local governments, and 
NGOs who support the reception and onward travel of arriving migrants 
at the SWB,'' the programs did not have this effect. As discussed in 
the preceding section, overall levels of CHNV migration at and between 
southwest border POEs did not fall dramatically year-over-year in FY 
2023 and FY 2024. In addition, if one takes into account the 532,000 
parolees who entered the United States at an interior POE, CHNV 
migration may have increased over the relevant time period. Recent 
policy interventions have proven more effective than the CHNV parole 
programs in addressing very high levels of illegal immigration.
    Over the past few years, there has been extensive public discussion 
of the effects of high levels of illegal immigration and inadmissible 
aliens arriving in local communities. Although public accounts of these 
effects do not always distinguish between aliens strictly on the basis 
of how they entered the country or their status (e.g., CHNV parolees; 
aliens whom DHS encountered at a southwest border POE placed in section 
240 removal proceedings; and aliens present without admission or 
parole), localities nationwide have experienced the effects of very 
high levels of migration.\33\ CHNV parolees and other recent arrivals 
have competed for limited resources such as housing, food, 
transportation, education, legal services, and public benefits.\34\ 
Some localities experienced surges of CHNV parolees in particular.\35\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The domestic impact of the CHNV parole program was also felt at the 
Federal level in at least three ways. First, the CHNV parole programs 
resulted in expanded eligibility for Federal public benefits. This is 
because, for instance, an alien who is paroled into the United States 
under INA 212(d)(5) for a period of at least 1 year is considered a 
``qualified alien.'' See 8 U.S.C. 1641(b)(4). Because DHS generally 
issued two-year periods of parole from the outset, CHNV parolees 
generally were considered qualified aliens. Although qualified aliens 
are generally subject to a five-year waiting period before becoming 
eligible for certain Federal public benefits, see, e.g., 8 U.S.C. 
1613(a) (five-year waiting period for Federal means-tested public 
benefits); 8 U.S.C. 1612(a)(2)(L) (general five-year waiting period 
before a qualified alien can receive supplemental nutrition assistance 
program (SNAP) benefits), such waiting periods do not apply to all CHNV 
parolees with respect to all public benefit programs. For instance, a 
parolee under the age of 18 may be eligible for SNAP benefits, see

[[Page 13615]]

7 CFR 273.4(a)(6)(ii)(J), as might ``a Cuban or Haitian entrant (as 
defined in section 501(e) of the Refugee Education Assistance Act of 
1980),'' see 7 CFR 273.4(a)(6)(ii)(E). Similarly, some states have 
extended Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program benefits 
without a five-year waiting period to ``lawfully residing'' children 
and pregnant women, which includes an alien who is paroled into the 
United States under INA 212(d)(5) for a period of at least 1 year.\36\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \36\ See 42 U.S.C. 1396b(v)(4) (Medicaid); 42 U.S.C. 
1397gg(e)(1)(O) (CHIP).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Second, the CHNV parole programs have exacerbated backlogs, or 
risked exacerbating backlogs, for the immigration system writ large. 
For example, the population of aliens paroled into the United States 
and who have filed an application for asylum contributes to an already 
taxed immigration system with historically high backlogs before USCIS 
and the Executive Office for Immigration Review (``EOIR'').\37\ Many 
such parolees may not otherwise have come to the United States and have 
exacerbated such backlogs or are likely to eventually do so. U.S. 
Citizenship and Immigration Services (``USCIS'') recently reported that 
as of the end of December 2024, the USCIS asylum backlog had increased 
to over 1.4 million cases.\38\ CHNV parolees account for approximately 
75,000 affirmative asylum applications.\39\ In addition, when a CHNV 
parolee's two-year parole period ends, if the CHNV parolee has no 
lawful basis to remain in the United States, DHS may place the alien in 
section 240 removal proceedings. But, due in part to the overwhelmed 
expedited removal system, EOIR's immigration court backlog has already 
been growing rapidly, and will be further strained by the initiation of 
additional removal proceedings for the CHNV parolee population once 
their parole period ends. The immigration court backlog increased by 
approximately 44 percent between the end of FY 2023 (2.5 million cases) 
and FY 2024 (3.6 million cases).\40\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Third, the CHNV parole programs had a disruptive impact for CBP 
operations at interior air POEs. A progressive increase in 
beneficiaries of the CHNV parole programs arriving at POEs with advance 
travel authorizations ``(ATAs'') were ultimately not granted parole due 
to CBP's determination that the alien did not warrant a discretionary 
grant of parole, for instance due to evidence of fraud or confirmation 
that the alien was a citizen or resident of a non-CHNV country. As a 
result, CBP processed these aliens for another appropriate disposition 
under Title 8, including detention or referral into expedited removal 
proceedings or section 240 removal proceedings, as appropriate. This 
caused further processing delays and coordination with air carriers for 
return flights when appropriate, and further contributed to the 
immigration court backlog.
    The overwhelmed immigration systems in particular may incentivize 
aliens to enter the United States, without regard to the strength of 
any potential claims for immigration status, as aliens who are subject 
to expedited removal may nevertheless be placed in section 240 removal 
proceedings when the system is strained beyond its processing capacity. 
As a result, many remain in the United States until their immigration 
benefit requests are adjudicated or their section 240 removal 
proceedings conclude and any resultant removal order is executed. Any 
further strain to the immigration systems resulting from aliens 
pursuing the CHNV parole programs exacerbates these detrimental 
incentives.
    In short, the domestic impact of the CHNV parole programs do not 
warrant continuing to operate these programs. Implementation of these 
programs coincided with an overall increase in CHNV migration, 
significant pressures on localities throughout the country, an 
expansion of public benefits eligibility, and a further exacerbation of 
USCIS and immigration court backlogs.

3. The CHNV Parole Programs Are Inconsistent With the Administration's 
Foreign Policy Goals

    One of the stated goals of the CHNV parole programs was to promote 
the foreign policy objectives of the prior administration. Indeed, DHS 
explained repeatedly in its notices promulgating the CHNV parole 
programs that their implementation would advance the foreign policy 
objectives of the then-current administration.\41\ The foreign policy 
objectives underlying the CHNV parole programs, however, are not 
consistent with those of the current Administration.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \41\ See e.g., 87 FR at 63516 (``the implementation of [the 
Venezuela process] will advance the Administration's foreign policy 
goals''); 88 FR at 1253 (``[the Haiti process] is fully aligned with 
larger and important foreign policy objectives of this 
Administration'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Executive Order 14150, ``America First Policy Directive to the 
Secretary of State'' (Jan. 20, 2025) clearly sets out the President's 
vision that ``the foreign policy of the United States shall champion 
core American interests and always put America and American citizens 
first.'' \42\ Executive Order 14159, ``Protecting the American People 
Against Invasion'' (Jan. 20, 2025) states that it is the policy of the 
United States to ``faithfully execute the immigration laws against all 
inadmissible and removable aliens, particularly those aliens who 
threaten the safety or security of the American people.'' Further, it 
is the policy of the United States to achieve the ``total and efficient 
enforcement of those laws, including through lawful incentives and 
detention capabilities.'' \43\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \42\ See Executive Order 14150, America First Policy Directive 
to the Secretary of State, 90 FR 8337 (Jan. 20, 2025) (published 
Jan. 29, 2025).

Against Invasion, 90 FR 8443 (Jan. 20, 2025) (published Jan. 29, 
2025).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Whereas implementation of the CHNV parole programs was contingent 
upon the Government of Mexico (``GOM'') making an independent decision 
to accept the return or removal of CHNV nationals who migrated 
illegally, the U.S. Government is pursuing a range of other policy 
initiatives that would allow DHS to return, remove, or deter the 
illegal migration of CHNV nationals and other aliens. Section 13 of 
that Executive Order 14159 specifically addresses repatriation, and 
directs the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security to take all 
appropriate action to cooperate and effectively implement, as 
appropriate, the sanctions provided by section 243(d) of the INA (8 
U.S.C. 1253(d)), and ensure that diplomatic efforts and negotiations 
with foreign states include the foreign states' acceptance of their 
nationals who are subject to removal from the United States. Section 13 
further directs the Secretaries to eliminate all documentary barriers, 
dilatory tactics, or other restrictions that prevent the prompt 
repatriation of aliens to any foreign state. The Order provides that 
any failure or delay by a foreign state to verify the identity of a 
national of that state shall be considered in carrying out section 
243(d) sanctions and shall also be considered regarding the issuance of

[[Page 13616]]

any other sanctions that may be available to the United States.
    Further, as noted above, Executive Order 14165, ``Securing Our 
Borders'' states that DHS shall ``terminate all categorical parole 
programs that are contrary to the policies of the United States 
established in [the President's] Executive Orders, including the 
program known as the `Processes for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and 
Venezuelans.' '' \44\ In the same Order, the President directed that as 
soon as practicable, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in 
coordination with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General, 
shall take all appropriate action to resume the Migrant Protection 
Protocols in all sectors along the southern border of the United States 
and ensure that, pending section 240 removal proceedings, aliens 
described in section 235(b)(2)(C) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(2)(C)) 
are returned to the territory from which they came.

    The President has pursued the cooperation of foreign partners in 
other ways as well. For instance:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Multiple agencies of the U.S. Government are actively pursuing the 
President's foreign policy goals. For instance, the Department of State 
has announced multiple discussions with neighboring countries regarding 
DHS's ability to remove or return illegal aliens,\50\ consistent with 
Secretary of State Rubio's January 22, 2025 announcement that a key 
priority of the Department of State is to curb mass migration and 
secure our borders.\51\ In that announcement, the Department of State 
made clear that it ``will no longer undertake any activities that 
facilitate or encourage mass migration'' and that ``[o]ur diplomatic 
relations with other countries, particularly in the Western Hemisphere, 
will prioritize securing America's borders, stopping illegal and 
destabilizing migration, and negotiating the repatriation of illegal 
immigrants.'' \52\ Additionally, pursuant to his authority under 
section 219 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1189,\53\ Secretary of State Rubio 
designated the Venezuelan gang, Tren de Aragua, along with other 
cartels and gangs, as Foreign Terrorist Organizations.\54\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \50\ See, e.g., U.S. Department of State, Readout, Secretary 
Rubio's Meeting with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele (Feb. 3,

promised to accept and incarcerate violent illegal immigrants, 
including members of the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang, but also 
criminal illegal migrants from any country.''), <a href="https://www.state.gov/secretary-rubios-meeting-with-salvadoran-president-nayib-bukele/">https://www.state.gov/secretary-rubios-meeting-with-salvadoran-president-nayib-bukele/</a>; U.S. Department of State, Readout, Secretary Rubio's

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In other words, in addition to directly fulfilling the President's 
directive to terminate the CHNV parole programs, this action 
complements and underscores the Administration's pivot to a foreign 
policy that prioritizes the United States' interests in a secure 
border. Regardless of whether the prior Administration saw the CHNV 
parole programs as a component of a regional migration management 
strategy, the current Administration is not pursuing that strategy. 
Rather, as described above, the current Administration has focused its 
foreign policy attention on other measures to deter and prevent the 
entry of illegal aliens into the United States and obtain complete 
operational control of our borders.
    These measures will allow DHS to better ``achieve the total and 
efficient enforcement'' of U.S. immigration law and, as such, champion 
a core American interest in accordance with the President's vision for 
American foreign policy.\55\ In short, the continued implementation of 
the CHNV parole programs no longer accords with the President's stated 
priorities and foreign policy objectives.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Other Factors Do Not Counsel in Favor of Maintaining the Programs

    The other factors cited by DHS in promulgating the CHNV parole 
programs also do not counsel in favor of maintaining the programs. For 
instance:
    <bullet> DHS predicted that by allowing DHS to vet aliens before 
they travel to the United States, the programs would enhance national 
security as compared to high levels of illegal immigration. But as 
discussed above, these programs are unnecessary to counter high levels 
of illegal immigration. In addition, and critically, such vetting is 
inherently limited and, as has been reported publicly, there were 
significant gaps in the vetting process. In response to these problems, 
the CHNV parole programs were paused briefly in July 2024 to evaluate 
the program vulnerabilities.\56\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \56\ Stephen Dinan, `Parole' program put on hold amid massive 
fraud; Homeland Security promises to set up safeguards, Wash. Times 
(Aug. 2, 2024), <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2024/aug/2/dhs-suspends-parole-program-amid-rampant-fraud/">https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2024/aug/2/dhs-suspends-parole-program-amid-rampant-fraud/</a>.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[Page 13617]]

    <bullet> DHS also initially reasoned that the CHNV parole programs 
would disincentivize a dangerous journey that puts aliens' lives and 
safety at risk and enriches smuggling networks. As noted above, 
however, although these programs were accompanied by a significant 
decrease in CHNV encounters between southwest border POEs, they were 
also accompanied by a significant increase in CHNV encounters at 
southwest land border POEs. This indicates that CHNV nationals 
continued to engage in dangerous migration to the southwest border, 
even if the overall level of migration to the southwest border dropped 
somewhat and CHNV aliens did not cross between POEs with the same 
frequency. And, as also noted above, the U.S. Government has 
implemented other policies that have more effectively deterred illegal 
immigration.
    <bullet> Another stated goal of the CHNV parole programs was to 
reduce the burden on DHS personnel and resources that would otherwise 
be required for detention, monitoring, processing, and removal. 
However, as noted above, significant resource burdens persisted even 
after the programs' implementation, including with respect to 
encounters at and between POEs. Program implementation itself occupied 
significant resources. For instance, there have been approximately 
2,970,000 Forms I-134 and I-134A filed with USCIS since October 
2022,\57\ which includes 2,140,000 pending review, 642,410 confirmed by 
USCIS, and 181,820 non-confirmed by USCIS.\58\ Further, DHS needed 
additional resources to counter the fraud, national security concerns, 
and public safety concerns discussed above. In addition, due to the 
originating location of beneficiaries of the CHNV parole programs and 
available travel routes via commercial airlines, over 80 percent of the 
aliens who were issued an ATA under the CHNV parole programs flew to 
Florida POEs. The unexpected increase in approximately 25,000 
inadmissible aliens per month resulted in CBP experiencing a decrease 
in enforcement operations and an increase in wait times, overtime 
expenditures, and other needs at Florida POEs. Processing an alien 
requesting parole under the CHNV parole programs requires secondary 
processing and enrollment of biometrics, resulting in a more extensive 
and prolonged time in CBP facilities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \57\ Under the parole program for Venezuelans, a U.S.-based 
supporter would initiate consideration for parole under the program 
by filing Form I-134, Declaration of Financial Support (Online), 
along with supporting evidence. 87 FR at 63515. In January 2023, 
when DHS expanded the programs to cover Cubans, Haitians, and 
Nicaraguans and their immediate family members as well, DHS 
announced that it would instead begin accepting the Form I-134A 
Online Request to be a Supporter and Declaration of Financial 
Support, along with supporting evidence, to initiate consideration 
for parole under all four programs. See, e.g., 88 FR at 1279. 
Neither form could be filed on paper by mail and neither form 
required the payment of a fee.
    \58\ OHSS analysis of USCIS Form I-134/Form I-134A data as of 
January 22, 2025. The Venezuelan parole program started on October 
18, 2022, and the Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua parole programs started 
January 6, 2023. ``Confirmed'' in this context meant that that USCIS 
had determined that the supporter was eligible to be a supporter and 
that they demonstrated the ability to financially support the 
beneficiary, while ``non-confirmed'' meant that USCIS had determined 
that the potential supporter had been determined to be ineligible to 
be a supporter or failed to demonstrate ability to financially 
support the beneficiary.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

IV. Reliance Interests of Prospective Supporters and Parolees

    In deciding whether and how to terminate the CHNV parole programs, 
DHS has considered potential reliance interests of a range of potential 
supporters and beneficiaries of these programs. At the outset, however, 
DHS observes that the temporary and discretionary nature of the 
programs indicate that reliance on the continued existence of the CHNV 
parole programs would be unwarranted. The notices establishing the CHNV 
parole programs expressly advise the public that, ``[t]he Secretary 
retains the sole discretion to terminate the [Parole Program] . . . at 
any point'' \59\ and that ``DHS may terminate parole in its discretion 
at any time.'' \60\ The CHNV parole programs were ``being implemented 
as a matter of the Secretary's discretion. [They are] not intended to 
and [do] not create any rights, substantive or procedural, enforceable 
by any party in any matter, civil or criminal.'' \61\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \60\ E.g., 88 FR at 1272 (Cuba).
    \61\ E.g., 88 FR at 1277 (Cuba).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In addition, DHS observes that on October 4, 2024, the prior 
administration announced that there was no re-parole process under 
CHNV, informing participants that, ``if you have not sought a lawful 
status or period of authorized stay, you will need to leave the United 
States before your authorized parole period expires, or you may be 
placed in removal proceedings after your period of parole expires.'' 
\62\ Finally, as noted above, Executive Order 14165 directs the 
Secretary to terminate the CHNV parole programs consistent with law.

    Notwithstanding that DHS made very clear that reliance on these 
programs would be inappropriate, that DHS made clear months ago that 
there would be no ``re-parole'' process under the CHNV parole programs, 
and the additional notice provided in Executive Order 14165, DHS has 
analyzed the effects of this action on any potential reliance interests 
in an abundance of caution.\63\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Reliance Interests of Potential Supporters and Beneficiaries

    DHS first considered the potential reliance interests of those 
U.S.-based supporters who had intended to file or have filed a Form I-
134A in support of a potential parolee. In general, the costs 
associated with such filings are minimal. The potential supporter may 
have incurred the opportunity cost of completing Form I-134A, estimated 
at 2.60 hours per response, and a few potential supporters who 
submitted Form I-134A may have submitted their biometrics (photograph 
and fingerprints) at a USCIS Application Support Center for biometric 
screening and vetting by USCIS as part of the review of their Form I-
134A.\64\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \64\ Biometrics submission is estimated to require 1.17 hours 
per respondent. 89 FR 104557 (Dec. 23, 2024).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    At this early stage in the process, the costs incurred by a 
potential beneficiary are also minimal. Once a supporter is confirmed, 
the potential beneficiary receives instructions to create a USCIS 
online account, confirm their biographic information in their online 
account, and attest to meeting the eligibility requirements, including 
public health requirements, and certain vaccination requirements. It is 
also possible that a beneficiary who has received instructions to 
create an online account may have obtained vaccinations in anticipation 
of the required attestation. After confirming their biographic 
information, the beneficiary received instructions to access the CBP 
One mobile application to enter biographic information and submit a 
live photo. CBP One was used to collect the beneficiary's biographic 
information and photo and was an additional step in the process prior 
to the alien being authorized to travel to the United States to seek 
parole. The total estimated time to complete the CBP One part of the

[[Page 13618]]

ATA process was 10 minutes. See 88 FR 62810, 62812 (Sept. 13, 2023).
    In general, these costs are not significant and pale in comparison 
to the U.S. Government's sovereign interest in determining who is 
paroled into the United States. DHS intends to issue a notice of non-
confirmation for all remaining pending Forms I-134A. DHS will also 
rescind the confirmation of all Form I-134A that were previously 
confirmed and issue updated notices of non-confirmation for any 
potential beneficiaries who have not yet traveled to a POE to seek 
parole. Potential beneficiaries will no longer be able to execute any 
attestations or seek ATA through a USCIS online account based on a 
previously confirmed Form I-134A.

2. Reliance Interests of Potential Beneficiaries With Approved ATAs and 
Their Supporters

    A beneficiary with an approved ATA may travel to the United States 
to seek a discretionary grant of parole. Authorization is generally 
valid for 90 days, and beneficiaries are responsible for securing their 
own travel, at no cost to the U.S. government, via commercial air to 
the United States.\65\ DHS intends to cancel all pending applications 
for advance authorizations to travel to the United States to seek a 
discretionary grant of parole under the CHNV parole programs. There are 
no currently approved ATAs upon which an alien may travel under the 
CHNV parole programs.\66\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \65\ Authorization to travel does not guarantee parole. Parole 
of the individual is a discretionary determination made by CBP when 
the individual arrives at the interior POE. See, e.g., 88 FR 1255, 
1264 (Jan. 9, 2023).
    \66\ OHSS analysis of advance travel authorization data provided 
by CBP PSPD and valid as of February 27, 2025.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A beneficiary whose application for an ATA is cancelled may have, 
for example, provided notice to their landlord, sold property, and/or 
resigned from employment. In addition, a confirmed Form I-134A 
supporter may have incurred expenses, for example, to secure living 
quarters or furniture for the beneficiary in anticipation of their 
process being completed through parole into the United States.
    DHS recognizes that the potential costs incurred by supporters and 
potential beneficiaries at this point could be viewed as significant. 
Nevertheless, as explained above, supporters and potential 
beneficiaries were apprised that DHS could terminate the programs at 
any point. Moreover, the notices for each parole program made it clear 
that the approval of an ATA or grant of parole at a POE was entirely 
discretionary. See, e.g., 88 FR 1243, 1252 (noting that a potential 
beneficiary may be ``ineligible for advance authorization to travel to 
the United States as well as parole under this process'' for a range of 
reasons, including if the alien ``fails to pass national security and 
public safety vetting or is otherwise deemed not to merit a favorable 
exercise of discretion''); 88 FR at 1253 (``Approval of advance 
authorization to travel does not guarantee parole into the United 
States. Whether to parole the [aliens] is a discretionary determination 
made by CBP at the POE at the time the [alien] arrives at the interior 
POE''); 88 FR at 1253 (``[Aliens] who . . . otherwise do not warrant 
parole pursuant to [section 212(d)(5)(A) of the INA], and as a matter 
of discretion upon inspection, . . . may be referred to ICE for 
detention.''). While the termination of the CHNV parole programs as 
provided in this notice may result in costs incurred by both the 
supporter and potential beneficiary who have prepared to travel to the 
United States, those parties chose to incur such expenses knowing that 
completion of the process was never guaranteed by the terms of the 
program, and the termination of the programs was possible at any time. 
DHS has concluded that any such reliance interests are outweighed by 
other interests and policy concerns as explained in this notice.\67\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \67\ DHS has considered the alternative of allowing any approved 
ATAs to remain in place until they were used or expired by their 
terms. Even if there were currently approved ATAs, DHS would not 
pursue this route, because DHS would not wish to incentivize aliens 
flying to the United States to seek parole under policies that DHS 
no longer supports or appear to encourage them to incur additional 
expenses based on a belief that they will be paroled upon arrival at 
the POE. Such an approach would risk exacerbating the problems 
created by the CHNV parole programs. As is always the case, however, 
CBP may consider a request for parole under DHS's existing parole 
authority, on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons 
or significant public benefit. If parole is not granted, the alien 
may be returned to their home country at U.S. Government expense or 
processed for another appropriate disposition under the INA.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

V. Effect of Termination on Current Parolees Under the CHNV Parole 
Programs and Corresponding Reliance Interests

    The notices establishing the CHNV parole programs explain that 
parole is not an admission of the alien to the United States, and a 
parolee remains an applicant for admission during the period of parole 
in the United States. See also INA 212(d)(5)(A), 8 U.S.C. 
1182(d)(5)(A). DHS may set the duration of the parole based on the 
purpose for granting the parole request and may impose reasonable 
conditions on parole. Id. Aliens may be granted advance authorization 
to travel to the United States to seek parole. See 8 CFR 212.5(f). The 
Secretary may terminate parole in her discretion at any time when, in 
her opinion, neither urgent humanitarian reasons nor significant public 
benefit warrants the continued presence of the alien in the United 
States, and parole shall be terminated when the purpose for which it 
was authorized has been accomplished. See 8 CFR 212.5(e). And, finally, 
aliens who are paroled into the United States, including those paroled 
through the CHNV parole programs, may generally apply for and be 
granted employment authorization under the (c)(11) employment 
eligibility category. See 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(11).
    As noted above, between October 19, 2022, and January 22, 2025, 
approximately 532,000 inadmissible aliens received parole into the 
United States pursuant to the CHNV parole programs. DHS has determined 
that as one aspect of the termination of the CHNV parole programs, 
consistent with the Secretary's statutory and regulatory authority,\68\ 
the parole of aliens who have been paroled into the United States under 
the CHNV parole programs and whose parole has not already expired by 
April 24, 2025 will terminate on that date unless the Secretary makes 
an individual determination to the contrary.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \68\ See INA 212(d)(5)(A), 8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5)(A) (``when the 
purposes of such parole shall, in the opinion of the Secretary of 
Homeland Security, have been served the alien shall forthwith return 
or be returned to the custody from which he was paroled and 
thereafter his case shall continue to be dealt with in the same 
manner as that of any other applicant for admission to the United 
States''); 8 CFR 212.5(e)(2)(i) (``[U]pon accomplishment of the 
purpose for which parole was authorized or when in the opinion of 
one of the officials listed in paragraph (a) of this section, 
neither humanitarian reasons nor public benefit warrants the 
continued presence of the alien in the United States, parole shall 
be terminated upon written notice to the alien. . . .'' (emphasis 
added)).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Following this termination, and consistent with the direction in 
Executive Order 14165, DHS generally intends to remove promptly aliens 
who entered the United States under the CHNV parole programs who do not 
depart the United States before their parole termination date and do 
not have any lawful basis to remain in the United States. DHS retains 
its discretion to commence enforcement action against any alien at any 
time, including during the 30-day waiting period created by this 
notice. Parolees without a lawful basis to remain in the United States 
following the termination of the CHNV programs must depart the United 
States

[[Page 13619]]

before their parole termination date. Aliens departing the United 
States via land border POEs should report their departure once outside 
the United States via the CBP Home mobile app. Aliens should visit 
<a href="https://i94.cbp.dhs.gov/home">https://i94.cbp.dhs.gov/home</a> for more information about voluntarily 
reporting their departure.
    In implementing this approach, DHS intends to prioritize for 
removal those who (1) have not, prior to the publication of this 
notice, properly filed an immigration benefit request, with appropriate 
fee (or fee waiver request, if available) to obtain a lawful basis to 
remain in the United States (e.g., adjustment of status, asylum, 
Temporary Protected Status, or T or U nonimmigrant status) and (2) are 
not the beneficiary of an immigration benefit request properly filed by 
someone else on their behalf (e.g., petition for alien relative, 
fianc[eacute] petition, petition for immigrant employee), with 
appropriate fee (or fee waiver request, if available). Aliens who have 
since obtained a lawful immigration status or other basis that permits 
them to remain in the United States are not required to depart the 
United States pursuant to this notice.
    Parole-based employment authorization under 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(11) 
automatically terminates upon (1) the expiration date specified on the 
employment authorization document, (2) DHS's institution of removal 
proceedings against the alien, or (3) a grant of voluntary departure. 
See 8 CFR 274a.14(a). Such employment authorization may also be revoked 
on notice consistent with the procedures in 8 CFR 274a.14(b). DHS has 
determined that, after termination of the parole, the condition upon 
which the employment authorization was granted no longer exists and 
thus DHS intends to revoke parole-based employment authorization 
consistent with those revocation on notice procedures. 8 CFR 
274a.14(b).
    DHS has considered the impacts on parolees who are affected by this 
discretionary decision to terminate their parole prior to the 
expiration of the parole period. DHS recognizes the costs incurred by 
some aliens who have been granted parole and traveled to the United 
States.\69\ Parolees will have departed their native country; traveled 
to the United States; obtained housing, employment authorization, and 
means of transportation; and perhaps commenced the process of building 
connections to the community where they reside.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \69\ See Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 579 U.S. 211, 221-22 
(2016) (``Agencies are free to change their existing policies as 
long as they provide a reasoned explanation for the change. . . . 
But the agency must at least display awareness that it is changing 
position and show that there are good reasons for the new policy. In 
explaining its changed position, an agency must also be cognizant 
that longstanding policies may have engendered serious reliance 
interests that must be taken into account.'' (cleaned up)).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    However, any assessment of the reliance interests of CHNV parolees 
must account for CHNV parolees' knowledge at the outset that (1) the 
Secretary retained the discretion to terminate the parole programs at 
any point in time, and to terminate any grants of parole at any time 
when, in her opinion, the purposes of such parole have been served 
\70\; and that (2) the initial term of parole would be limited to a 
maximum of two years. These clear, limiting conditions of the parole 
programs served to attenuate any long-term expectations and interests 
amongst CHNV parolees. Accordingly, DHS has taken these limiting 
conditions, along with CHNV parolees' knowledge of them, into 
consideration when weighing their reliance interests.\71\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \70\ As explained throughout this notice, the Secretary has 
determined that the purposes of parole under the CHNV programs have 
been served because, inter alia, the CHNV parole programs are 
unnecessary to achieve border security goals; the domestic impact of 
the CHNV parole programs was too great; and the programs are 
inconsistent with this Administration's foreign policy goals.
    \71\ See DHS v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 591 U.S. 1, 32 
(2020) (noting that DHS could conclude that reliance is 
``unjustified in light of the express limitations'' in relevant 
immigration policy).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    DHS has concluded that the potential reliance interests among 
aliens paroled into the United States under the CHNV parole programs do 
not outweigh the U.S. government's strong interest in promptly removing 
parolees when the basis for the underlying program no longer exists. To 
effectuate their prompt removal, the U.S. government may in its 
discretion initiate expedited removal proceedings where appropriate. 
Expedited removal is available only when an alien has not been 
continuously present in the United States for at least the two years 
preceding the date of the inadmissibility determination. INA 
235(b)(1)(iii)(II), 8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(1)(iii)(II); 8 CFR 235.3.\72\ If 
DHS were to allow the CHNV parolee population to remain for the full 
duration of their two-year parole, DHS would be compelled to place a 
greater proportion of this population in section 240 removal 
proceedings to effectuate their removal, further straining the already 
over-burdened immigration court system discussed in Section III.1.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \72\ See Designating Aliens for Expedited Removal, 90 FR 8139 
(Jan. 24, 2025).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    To the extent that current parolees have obtained housing and 
employment authorization, or created new ties within the community 
while in the United States, DHS notes these interests are qualitatively 
less than any reliance interests that might be attributed to the 
Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) recipient population 
consistent with the discussion in DHS v. Regents of the Univ. of 
Cal.\73\ In Regents, the Supreme Court reviewed whether DHS had 
appropriately considered the reliance interests of DACA recipients when 
rescinding DACA.\74\ The reliance interests of DACA recipients, all of 
whom had been present in the United States for far longer than two 
years, included their enrollment in degree programs, the beginning of 
their careers, the starting of businesses, and the purchase of 
homes.\75\ As the Court noted, these interests, though noteworthy, were 
not ``necessarily dispositive,'' and ``DHS may determine, in the 
particular context before it, that other interests and policy concerns 
[in rescinding DACA] outweigh any reliance interests.'' \76\ For the 
purposes of the actions announced in this notice, DHS notes the 
reliance interests of those paroled under the CHNV parole programs are 
far less than the population in Regents. Further, as stated above, the 
reliance interests under the CHNV parole programs must take into 
account the express, discretionary terms of the parole program. 
Accordingly, the reliance interests are outweighed by the U.S. 
government's strong interest in promptly returning parolees when the 
basis for the underlying parole no longer exists.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Third parties, including employers, landlords, and others, may also 
have indirect reliance interests in the availability of individual CHNV 
parolees, but even if DHS had allowed the grants of parole to expire at 
the end of their designated terms, such third parties would have 
experienced the effects of such expiration. By providing 30 days' 
notice, DHS balances the benefits of a wind-down period for aliens and 
third parties with the exigency of promptly enforcing the law against 
those aliens lacking a lawful basis to remain in the United States. For 
the same reasons set forth above, DHS finds the U.S. government's 
interest in terminating these grants of parole outweigh any reliance 
interest of third parties.
    DHS has considered the alternative of permitting CHNV participants' 
parole to remain in effect until the natural expiration of the parole, 
as DHS has in

[[Page 13620]]

the past done with some parole terminations. See, e.g., 82 FR 38926, 
38927 (Aug. 16, 2017). However, DHS has opted to not pursue this route. 
As explained above, this would essentially foreclose DHS's ability to 
expeditiously remove those CHNV parolees with no lawful basis to remain 
in the United States. Under this alternative, CHNV parolees may begin 
to accrue more than two years of continuous presence in the United 
States, such that DHS would have to initiate section 240 removal 
proceedings to effectuate their removal. See INA 235(b)(1)(iii)(II), 8 
U.S.C. 1235(b)(1)(iii)(II). As a result, the already overburdened 
immigration court system would be further taxed with adjudicating the 
section 240 removal proceedings for the pertinent CHNV beneficiary 
population, a result DHS finds unacceptable.
    DHS has also considered the alternative of a longer than 30-day 
wind-down period. After due consideration, DHS has also decided not to 
pursue this option. As discussed above, DHS has a strong interest in 
preserving the ability to initiate expedited removal proceedings to the 
maximum extent possible for the appropriate CHNV population to prevent 
further straining of the over-burdened immigration court system. Any 
lengthening of the wind-down period will increase the likelihood that 
additional CHNV parolees are no longer subject to expedited 
removal.\77\ DHS has determined that a 30-day wind-down period provides 
affected parties sufficient notice while also preserving DHS's ability 
to enforce the law promptly against those CHNV parolees lacking a 
lawful basis to remain in the United States. Accordingly, DHS is opting 
not to increase the wind-down period to more than 30 days.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \77\ According to OHSS analysis of data provided by USCIS, for 
each month from March 2025 through September 2026, there are 
thousands of CHNV parolees who will become ineligible for expedited 
removal upon the natural expiration of their two-year parole.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

VI. Federal Register Notice as Constructive Notice

    This Federal Register notice serves as notice of the termination of 
the CHNV parole programs and satisfies the requirement that DHS provide 
written notice upon the termination of parole. See 8 CFR 212.5(e)(2)(i) 
(``. . . Upon accomplishment of the purpose for which parole was 
authorized or when in the opinion of one of the officials listed in 
paragraph (a) of this section, neither humanitarian reasons nor public 
benefit warrants the continued presence of the alien in the United 
States, parole shall be terminated upon written notice to the alien. . 
. .'' (emphasis added)). For the reasons set forth above, the Secretary 
has concluded that neither urgent humanitarian reasons nor significant 
public benefit warrants the continued presence of aliens paroled under 
the CHNV programs and the purposes of such parole therefore have been 
served. This notice accordingly serves as written notice to CHNV 
parolees.
    DHS has determined that publication of this notice in the Federal 
Register is legally sufficient notice to all interested or affected 
persons regardless of actual knowledge or hardship resulting from 
ignorance. See 44 U.S.C. 1507; Friends of Sierra R.R., Inc. v. I.C.C., 
881 F.2d 663, 667-68 (9th Cir. 1989); see also Fed. Crop Ins. Corp. v. 
Merrill, 332 U.S. 380, 385 (1947) (``Congress has provided that the 
appearance of rules and regulations in the Federal Register gives legal 
notice of their contents.'').
    DHS finds Federal Register publication of the decision to terminate 
existing grants of parole to be the most practicable approach in light 
of the size of the affected population and potential noncompliance with 
change-of-address reporting requirements. See 8 U.S.C. 1305; 8 CFR 
265.1. Because all CHNV parolees should have a USCIS online account and 
all processing under these parole programs took place electronically, 
DHS will also provide individual notice to each parolee through their 
USCIS online account. Cf., e.g., 8 CFR 103.2(b)(19)(ii)(B) (``For 
applications or petitions filed electronically, USCIS will notify both 
the applicant or petitioner and the authorized attorney or accredited 
representative electronically of any notices or decisions. . . .''). 
This notice, and the individual notice through the USCIS online 
account, each independently constitute ``written notice to the alien'' 
under 8 CFR 212.5(e)(2)(i).

VII. Administrative Procedure Act

    This notice is exempt from notice-and-comment rulemaking 
requirements because DHS is merely adopting a general statement of 
policy, 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A). i.e., a ``statement [ ] issued by an agency 
to advise the public prospectively of the manner in which the agency 
proposes to exercise a discretionary power.'' Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 
U.S. 182, 197 (1993) (quoting Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, 441 U.S. 281, 
302 n.31 (1979)). By terminating the CHNV parole programs--which 
themselves constituted general statements of policy, see, e.g., 88 FR 
at 1277--DHS is explaining how it will implement the Secretary's broad 
discretion for exercising her narrow parole authority. Accordingly, 
this notice of termination constitutes a general statement of policy 
and is exempt from the notice-and-comment rulemaking requirements under 
the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).\78\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \78\ Cf. Perez v. Mortg. Bankers Ass'n, 575 U.S. 92, 101 
(``Because an agency is not required to use notice-and-comment 
procedures to issue an initial interpretive rule, it is also not 
required to use those procedures when it amends or repeals that 
interpretive rule.'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    When an agency merely explains how it will enforce a statute or 
regulation by describing how it will exercise its broad enforcement 
discretion, as was the case with the CHNV parole programs, it is a 
general statement of policy. See Lincoln, 508 U.S. at 197. Section 
212(d)(5)(A) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5)(A) provides the Secretary 
broad discretion in exercising the parole authority, with parole 
decisions made by the Secretary of Homeland Security ``in [her] 
discretion.'' The CHNV parole programs therefore were general 
statements of policy.
    Because the CHNV parole programs constitute general statements of 
policy and were exempt from notice-and-comment rulemaking requirements 
under the APA, their termination likewise is a mere general statement 
of policy exempt from the notice and comment rulemaking requirements. 
Through the termination of the CHNV parole programs and for the reasons 
given, DHS is merely making a change to a previous policy statement on 
the exercise of its discretionary parole authority.\79\ Accordingly, 
there is no requirement to publish notice prior to the termination's 
effective date, and it is therefore amenable to immediate issuance and 
implementation.\80\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \79\ See Encino Motorcars, 579 U.S. at 221 (``Agencies are free 
to change their existing policies as long as they provide a reasoned 
explanation for the change.'').
    \80\ See 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(2).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Even if the changes were considered to be a legislative rule that 
would normally be subject to notice and comment rulemaking and a 
delayed effective date, these changes--like the implementation of the 
parole programs themselves \81\--pertain to a foreign affairs function 
of the United States, and are exempt from such procedural requirements 
on that basis.\82\ Consistent

[[Page 13621]]

with the Secretary of State's February 21, 2025 determination that 
``all efforts, conducted by any agency of the federal government, to 
control the status, entry, and exit of people, and the transfer of 
goods, services, data, technology, and other items across the borders 
of the United States, constitute a foreign affairs function of the 
United States[,]'' DHS finds that these changes are connected to the 
entry and exit of people and thereby constitute a foreign affairs 
function.\83\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \81\ See 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1); 88 FR at 1277; 88 FR at 1253; 88 FR 
at 1264; 87 FR at 63516 (as modified by 88 FR 1279).
    \82\ See Am. Ass'n of Exps. & Imps.-Textile & Apparel Grp. v. 
United States, 751 F.2d 1239, 1249 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (noting that 
foreign affairs exception covers agency actions ``linked intimately 
with the Government's overall political agenda concerning relations 
with another country''); Yassini v. Crosland, 618 F.2d 1356, 1361 
(9th Cir. 1980) (because an immigration directive ``was implementing 
the President's foreign policy,'' the action ``fell within the 
foreign affairs function and good cause exceptions to the notice and 
comment requirements of the APA'').
    \83\ U.S. Secretary of State, Determination: Foreign Affairs 
Functions of the United States, 90 FR 12200 (Feb. 21, 2025) 
(published Mar. 14, 2025). The Secretary of State's determination 
references and implements numerous Presidential actions reflecting 
the President's top foreign policy priorities, including Executive 
Order 14165. As noted above, Executive Order 14165 specifically 
directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to, consistent with 
applicable law, take all appropriate action to terminate the CHNV 
parole programs.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Moreover, although the APA does not require the agency to show that 
such procedures may result in ``definitely undesirable international 
consequences'' to invoke the foreign affairs exemption to notice-and-
comment rulemaking, some courts have required such a showing,\84\ and 
DHS can make one here. Delaying rescission of the CHNV parole programs 
to undertake rulemaking would undermine the U.S. Government's ability 
to conduct foreign policy, including the ability to shift governmental 
policies and engage in delicate and time-sensitive negotiations 
following a change in Administration. It is the view of the United 
States that the termination of these parole programs will fulfill 
important foreign policy goals that the President has repeatedly 
articulated and urged DHS to implement swiftly; any delay in achieving 
such goals is definitely undesirable.

2008).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As explained in Section III.3 of this notice, the CHNV parole 
programs were implemented as an integral part of negotiations with 
regional neighbors, including Mexico, to address unlawful migratory 
flows challenging immigration systems throughout the region. For 
instance, in announcing the Venezuela parole program, DHS explained 
that even if the program were considered to be a legislative rule that 
would normally be subject to requirements for notice-and-comment 
rulemaking and a delayed effective date, the program would be exempt 
from such requirements because it involves a foreign affairs function 
of the United States.\85\ DHS cautioned that it ``will not implement 
the new parole process without the ability to return Venezuelan 
nationals who enter [unlawfully] to Mexico, and the United States' 
ability to execute this process thus requires the GOM's willingness to 
accept into Mexico those who bypass this new process and enter the 
United States [unlawfully] between POEs.'' DHS explained that 
``initiating and managing this process will require careful, 
deliberate, and regular assessment of the GOM's responses to this 
unilateral U.S. action and ongoing, sensitive diplomatic engagements.'' 
\86\ DHS noted that the program was ``not only responsive to the 
interests of key foreign partners--and necessary for addressing 
migration issues requiring coordination between two or more 
governments--[but] also fully aligned with larger and important foreign 
policy objectives of [the prior] Administration and fits within a web 
of carefully negotiated actions by multiple governments.'' \87\ When 
implementing the Cuba, Haiti, and Nicaragua parole programs, DHS 
invoked the foreign affairs exemption on similar grounds.\88\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yet, as also discussed in Section III.3 of this notice, U.S. 
foreign policy has changed in critical respects, and DHS must 
expeditiously align its policies to that change. Whereas implementation 
of the CHNV parole programs was contingent upon the GOM making an 
independent decision to accept the return or removal of CHNV nationals 
who migrated illegally, the U.S. Government is pursuing a range of 
other policy initiatives that would allow DHS to return or remove CHNV 
nationals, including re-implementation of the Migrant Protection 
Protocols and improved cooperation and coordination with other 
countries regarding return or removal of their or third country 
nationals.
    In the context of these complex and time-sensitive diplomatic 
negotiations, it would be counterproductive to retain vestiges of a 
foreign policy approach that the United States is no longer pursuing, 
even temporarily, to allow for a period of public comment about matters 
that implicate our foreign affairs and are ultimately within the 
Executive's discretion. Continuing to administer the CHNV parole 
programs pending notice-and-comment would adversely affect the United 
States' ability to pivot rapidly to a more effective approach in these 
negotiations and may result in an even greater number of CHNV nationals 
requiring removal or return. Further delay in pursuing these more 
effective approaches would be particularly pernicious in the context of 
ongoing negotiations, as discussed in section III.3 of this notice, 
with countries to accept the removal of illegal aliens, including 
inadmissible CHNV nationals.
    Finally, and for the same reasons that a delay in implementing this 
action would result in undesirable international consequences, even if 
notice-and-comment and a delayed effective date were required, DHS has 
determined that the good cause exemptions to notice-and-comment 
rulemaking and the 30-day effective date apply and that the delay 
associated with implementing these changes through notice-and-comment 
rulemaking or delaying the effective date would be impracticable and 
contrary to the public interest. Any delay for such procedures would 
harm the U.S. Government's ability to timely implement the current 
Administration's foreign policy approach and exacerbate the challenges 
associated with the CHNV parole programs, as explained throughout this 
notice, contrary to the President's direction to protect the American 
people against invasion and to secure the border. Such an outcome would 
also be inconsistent with the fundamentally discretionary nature of 
DHS's parole authority.\89\

Activities Grp. v. EPA, 236 F.3d 749, 754-55 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (``a 
situation is `impracticable' when an agency finds that due and 
timely execution of its functions would be impeded by the notice 
otherwise required''); see also Executive Order 14159, 90 FR 8443 
(Jan. 20, 2025) (published Jan. 29, 2025).

VIII. Severability

    DHS intends for the decisions announced in this notice to be 
severable from each other and to be given effect to the maximum extent 
possible, such that if a court holds that any provision is invalid or 
unenforceable--whether in their entirety or as to a particular person 
or circumstance--the other provisions will remain in effect as to any 
other person or circumstance.\90\ The various decisions in this notice 
are designed to function sensibly without the others, and DHS intends 
for them to be severable so that each can operate independently.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \90\ Courts have uniformly held that the APA, 5 U.S.C. 706(2), 
authorizes courts to sever and set aside ``only the offending parts 
of the rule.'' Carlson v. Postal Regulatory Comm'n, 938 F.3d 337, 
351 (D.C. Cir. 2019); see, e.g., K Mart Corp. v. Cartier, Inc., 486 
U.S. 281, 294 (1988).

    For example, DHS would intend that the termination of the CHNV 
parole programs be implemented immediately, even if the termination of 
ATAs or existing grants of parole were to be enjoined in whole or in 
part. This approach ensures that DHS is able to implement its policy 
choices, and the President's direction in Executive Order 14165, to the 
maximum extent possible.

IX. Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA)

    This rule does not promulgate new or revise existing 
``collection[s] of information'' as that term is defined under the 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, Public Law 104-13, 109 Stat. 163, 44 
U.S.C. chapter 35, and its implementing regulations, 5 CFR part 1320.
