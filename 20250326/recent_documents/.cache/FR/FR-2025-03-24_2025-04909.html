INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMISSION

[Investigation Nos. 701-TA-757 and 731-TA-1737-1738 (Preliminary)]


Polypropylene Corrugated Boxes From China and Vietnam; 
Institution of Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Investigations and 
Scheduling of Preliminary Phase Investigations

AGENCY: United States International Trade Commission.

ACTION: Notice.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Commission hereby gives notice of the institution of 
investigations and commencement of preliminary phase antidumping and 
countervailing duty investigation Nos. 701-TA-757 and 731-TA-1737-1738 
(Preliminary) pursuant to the Tariff Act of 1930 (``the Act'') to 
determine whether there is a reasonable indication that an industry in 
the United States is materially injured or threatened with material 
injury, or the establishment of an industry in the United States is 
materially retarded, by reason of imports of polypropylene corrugated 
boxes (``PC boxes'') from China and Vietnam, provided for in subheading 
3923.10.90 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, that 
are alleged to be sold in the United States at less than fair value and 
imports of PC boxes alleged to be subsidized by the Government of 
China. Unless the Department of Commerce (``Commerce'') extends the 
time for initiation, the Commission must reach preliminary 
determinations in antidumping and countervailing duty investigations in 
45 days, or in this case by May 2, 2025. The Commission's views must be 
transmitted to Commerce within five business days thereafter, or by May 
9, 2025.

DATES: March 18, 2025.
