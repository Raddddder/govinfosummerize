SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

I. Executive Summary

    This interim final rule (IFR) removes a specific provision of the 
Code of Federal Regulations introduced by the April 30, 2024 
``Unaccompanied Children Program Foundational Rule'' (Foundational 
Rule) at 45 CFR 410.1201(b). This provision precludes ORR from 
``shar[ing] any immigration status information relating to potential 
sponsors with any law enforcement or immigration enforcement related 
entity at any time.'' The regulatory provision conflicts with a federal 
statute, which provides, in part, as follows:
    Notwithstanding any other provision of Federal, State, or local 
law, a Federal, State, or local government entity or official may not 
prohibit, or in any way restrict, any government entity or official 
from sending to, or receiving from, the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service information regarding the citizenship or immigration status, 
lawful or unlawful, of any individual.
    8 U.S.C. 1373(a). Inasmuch as the regulation directly conflicts 
with federal law, it is ``not in accordance with law,'' 5 U.S.C. 
706(2)(A), and is thus subject to invalidation. Accordingly, the 
information-sharing provision of the Foundational Rule must be removed.

II. Background and Scope of Regulatory Action

    On April 30, 2024, ORR published the ``Unaccompanied Children 
Program Foundational Rule,'' which establishes regulations relating to 
key aspects of the placement, care, and services provided to 
unaccompanied alien children referred to the Office of Refugee 
Resettlement (ORR), pursuant to ORR's responsibilities for coordinating 
and implementing the care and placement of unaccompanied alien children 
who are in Federal custody by reason of their immigration status under 
the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (HSA) and the William Wilberforce 
Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (TVPRA). 
Consistent with its statutory responsibilities, ORR must, among other 
things, conduct safety and suitability assessments of potential 
sponsors for the child. See generally 8 U.S.C. 1232(c)(3). As explained 
in the preamble to the Foundational Rule, in the process of vetting 
potential sponsors for unaccompanied alien children, the potential 
sponsor's immigration status is one factor that bears on the potential 
sponsor's suitability to care for the child. See 89 FR at 34442 (``To 
the extent ORR does collect information on the immigration status of a 
potential sponsor, it would be only for the purposes of evaluating the 
potential sponsor's ability to provide care for the child.''). And so 
ORR may collect information on the potential sponsor's immigration 
status, independent of a law enforcement or immigration enforcement 
purpose. Id.
    In the Foundational Rule, ORR included a provision stating: ``ORR 
shall not disqualify potential sponsors based solely on their 
immigration status and shall not collect information on immigration 
status of potential sponsors for law enforcement or immigration 
enforcement related purposes. ORR shall not share any immigration 
status information relating to potential sponsors with any law 
enforcement or immigration enforcement related entity at any time.'' 45 
CFR 410.1201(b). But this provision contravenes a federal statute: it 
contravenes existing statutory limitations on ORR's authority described 
at 8 U.S.C. 1373. And so, it must be excised from the Foundational 
Rule.
    ORR's authority is limited by 8 U.S.C. 1373(a) and (b). Subsection 
(a) states: ``Notwithstanding any other provision of Federal, State, or 
local law, a Federal, State, or local government entity or official may 
not prohibit, or in any way restrict, any government entity or official 
from sending to, or receiving from, the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service information regarding the citizenship or immigration status, 
lawful or unlawful, of any individual.'' Subsection (b) states: 
``Notwithstanding any other provision of Federal, State, or local law, 
no person or agency may prohibit, or in any way restrict, a Federal, 
State, or local government entity from doing any of the following with 
respect to information regarding the immigration status, lawful or 
unlawful, of any individual: (1) Sending such information to, or 
requesting or receiving such information

[[Page 13555]]

from, the Immigration and Naturalization Service. (2) Maintaining such 
information. (3) Exchanging such information with any other Federal, 
State, or local government entity.''
    The statute unambiguously limits ORR's authority. Notably, nowhere 
in the preamble to the Foundational Rule was 8 U.S.C. 1373 even 
mentioned, even though the information-sharing provision of the 
Foundational Rule, 45 CFR 410.1201(b), obviously and directly 
contravenes that statutory limit. Thus, ORR must update the 
Foundational Rule to strike 45 CFR 410.1201(b), effective 
immediately.\1\ That is, ORR removes the prohibition on sharing 
immigration status information relating to potential sponsors with law 
enforcement and immigration enforcement entities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The Foundational Rule contains a severability provision. 45 
CFR 410.1000. 45 CFR 410.1201(b)'s parts are inextricably linked and 
there was no indication in the Foundational Rule that it was 
intended to treat the information-sharing and the eligibility issues 
as distinct. In the alternative, as explained in the preamble of the 
Foundational Rule, 89 FR at 34389, that severability runs--at most--
to provisions, not to portions of provisions. Thus, for this 
alternative reason as well, the entirety of 45 CFR 410.1201(b) must 
be removed due to the conflict with 8 U.S.C. 1373.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

III. Good Cause for Issuing This IFR

    Under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), notice 
and public comment is not required when an agency, for good cause, 
finds it is impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public 
interest. The agency must incorporate a statement of the finding and 
the agency's reasons in the rule issued.
    HHS finds there is good cause to dispense with notice and comment 
here and issue this as an IFR. As explained above, 45 CFR 410.1201(b) 
contravenes 8 U.S.C. 1373. ORR had no authority to promulgate such a 
rule; revoking it immediately is in the public interest; and notice and 
comment is unnecessary and contrary to the public interest because no 
amount of public input could give ORR the power to contravene a duly-
enacted law of Congress via regulation.

IV. Good Cause for Immediate Effect

    Good cause exists for immediate effect, see 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3), 
because this IFR brings an ORR regulation into compliance with a 
federal statute and regulated entities do not need time to adjust their 
behavior before this rule takes effect.

V. Public Participation

    ORR encourages all interested parties to participate in this 
rulemaking by submitting written comments, views, and data on any or 
all aspects of this IFR. ORR also invites comments that relate to the 
economic, environmental, or federalism effects that might result from 
this IFR. ORR will review all comments received, but ORR will only post

recommended change, and include data, information, or authority that 
support such recommended change. If you submit comments, please 
indicate the specific section of this document to which each comment 
applies and provide a reason for each suggestion or recommendation. You 
may submit your comments and materials online or by email, but please

V. Regulatory Analyses

    This IFR meets the applicable standards set forth in sections 3(a) 
and 3(b)(2) of Executive Order 12988, Civil Justice Reform, to minimize 
litigation, eliminate ambiguity, and reduce burden.
    The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) only applies in situations 
where an agency engages in notice-and-comment rulemaking. 5 U.S.C. 
603(a). It does not apply here, because the agency is promulgating an 
IFR effective immediately without preceding notice and comment. The 
same is true for analysis pursuant to the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act 
(UMRA). 2 U.S.C. 1532(a). Moreover, the Foundational Rule explains the 
non-applicability of the UMRA. See 89 FR at 34582.
    Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), HHS is required to 
provide 60-day notice in the Federal Register and solicit public 
comment before a collection of information requirement is submitted to 
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval. An 
agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to 
respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a control 
number assigned by OMB. The PRA does not apply here because this IFR 
does not establish a collection of information; it removes a limitation 
in the Foundational Rule that conflicts with federal law.
    In accordance with section 6 of Executive Order 13132, it is 
determined that this IFR does not have sufficient federalism 
implications to warrant the preparation of a federalism summary impact 
statement. This comports with the same determination made in the 
Foundational Rule. See 89 FR at 34583.
    Section 654 of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations 
Act of 1999 requires Federal agencies to determine whether a policy or 
regulation may affect family well-being. If the agency's determination 
is affirmative, then the agency must prepare an impact assessment 
addressing criteria specified in the law. This regulation will not have 
an impact on family well-being as defined in this legislation, which 
asks agencies to assess policies with respect to whether the policy: 
strengthens or erodes family stability and the authority and rights of 
parents in the education, nurture, and supervision of their children; 
helps the family perform its functions; and increases or decreases 
disposable income.
