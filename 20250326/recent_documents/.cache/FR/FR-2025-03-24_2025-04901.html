SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Office of Disability Employment Policy 
within the U.S. Department of Labor requests clearance for data 
collection activities to support identifying the obstacles and 
facilitators to the employment of autistic young adults. Specifically, 
this request covers collection of data through a large-scale survey of 
autistic young adults ages 16 to 28, as well as qualitative telephone 
or web interviews with autistic young adults to augment the survey. 
This study (referred to as Research Support Services for Employment of 
Young Adults on the Autism Spectrum) will provide insightful data on 
the employment experiences of young adults on the autism spectrum, 
which policymakers and the autism community can use to inform program 
and policy changes that support the well-being of autistic people. For 
additional substantive information about this ICR, see the related 
notice published in the Federal Register on August 12, 2024 (89 FR 
65672).
    This information collection is subject to the PRA. A Federal agency 
generally cannot conduct or sponsor a collection of information, and 
the public is generally not required to respond to an information 
collection, unless the OMB approves it and displays a currently valid 
OMB Control Number. In addition, notwithstanding any other provisions 
of law, no person shall generally be subject to penalty for failing to 
comply with a collection of information that does not display a valid 
OMB Control Number. See 5 CFR 1320.5(a) and 1320.6.
    DOL seeks PRA authorization for this information collection for 
three (3) years. OMB authorization for an ICR cannot be for more than 
three (3) years without renewal. The DOL notes that information 
collection requirements submitted to the OMB for existing ICRs receive 
a month-to-month extension while they undergo review.
