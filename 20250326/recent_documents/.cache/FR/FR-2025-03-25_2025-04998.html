AGENCY: United States International Trade Commission.

ACTION: Notice.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Commission hereby gives notice of the scheduling of a full

whether termination of the suspended investigation on fresh tomatoes

material injury within a reasonably foreseeable time. The Commission 
has determined to exercise its authority to extend the review period by 
up to 90 days.

DATES: March 18, 2025.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Background.--On November 4, 2024, the Commission determined that 
responses to its notice of institution of the subject five-year review 
were such that a full review should proceed (89 FR 96681, December 5, 
2024); accordingly, a full review is being scheduled pursuant to 
section 751(c)(5) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1675(c)(5)). A 
record of the Commissioners' votes, the Commission's statement on 
adequacy, and any individual Commissioner's statements are available 
from the Office of the Secretary and at the Commission's website.
    Participation in the review and public service list.--Persons, 
including industrial users of the subject merchandise and, if the 
merchandise is sold at the retail level, representative consumer 
organizations, wishing to participate in this review as parties must 
file an entry of appearance with the Secretary to the Commission, as 
provided in section 201.11 of the Commission's rules, by 45 days after 
publication of this notice. A party that filed a notice of appearance 
following publication of the Commission's notice of institution of the 
review need not file an additional notice of appearance. The Secretary 
will maintain a public service list containing the names and addresses 
of all persons, or their representatives, who are parties to the 
review.
    For further information concerning the conduct of this review and 
rules of general application, consult the Commission's Rules of 
Practice and Procedure, part 201, subparts A and B (19 CFR part 201), 
and part 207,

subparts A, D, E, and F (19 CFR part 207).
    Please note the Secretary's Office will accept only electronic 
filings during this time. Filings must be made through the Commission's 
Electronic Document Information System (EDIS, <a href="https://edis.usitc.gov">https://edis.usitc.gov</a>). 
No in-person paper-based filings or paper copies of any electronic 
filings will be accepted until further notice.
    Limited disclosure of business proprietary information (BPI) under 
an administrative protective order (APO) and BPI service list.--
Pursuant to section 207.7(a) of the Commission's rules, the Secretary 
will make BPI gathered in this review available to authorized 
applicants under the APO issued in the review, provided that the 
application is made by 45 days after publication of this notice. 
Authorized applicants must represent interested parties, as defined by 
19 U.S.C. 1677(9), who are parties to the review. A party granted 
access to BPI following publication of the Commission's notice of 
institution of the review need not reapply for such access. A separate 
service list will be maintained by the Secretary for those parties 
authorized to receive BPI under the APO.
    Staff report.--The prehearing staff report in the review will be 
placed in the nonpublic record on July 29, 2025, and a public version 
will be issued thereafter, pursuant to section 207.64 of the 
Commission's rules.
    Hearing.--The Commission will hold an in-person hearing in 
connection with the review beginning at 9:30 a.m. on August 14, 2025. 
Requests to appear at the hearing should be filed in writing with the 
Secretary to the Commission on or before 5:15 p.m. on August 8, 2025. 
Any requests to appear as a witness via videoconference must be 
included with your request to appear. Requests to appear via 
videoconference must include a statement explaining why the witness 
cannot appear in person; the Chairman, or other person designated to 
conduct the review, may in their discretion for good cause shown, grant 
such a request. Requests to appear as remote witness due to illness or 
a positive COVID-19 test result may be submitted by 3 p.m. the business 
day prior to the hearing. Further information about participation in 
the hearing will be posted on the Commission's website at <a href="https://www.usitc.gov/calendarpad/calendar.html">https://www.usitc.gov/calendarpad/calendar.html</a>.
    A nonparty who has testimony that may aid the Commission's 
deliberations may request permission to present a short statement at 
the hearing. All parties and nonparties desiring to appear at the 
hearing and make oral presentations should attend a prehearing 
conference, if deemed necessary, to be held at 9:30 a.m. on August 12, 
2025. Parties shall file and serve written testimony and presentation 
slides in connection with their presentation at the hearing by no later 
than noon on August 13, 2025. Oral testimony and written materials to 
be submitted at the public hearing are governed by sections 
201.6(b)(2), 201.13(f), and 207.24 of the Commission's rules. Parties 
must submit any request to present a portion of their hearing testimony 
in camera no later than 7 business days prior to the date of the 
hearing.
    Written submissions.--Each party to the review may submit a 
prehearing brief to the Commission. Prehearing briefs must conform with 
the provisions of section 207.65 of the Commission's rules; the 
deadline for filing is 5:15 p.m. on August 7, 2025. Parties shall also 
file written testimony in connection with their presentation at the 
hearing, and posthearing briefs, which must conform with the provisions 
of section 207.67 of the Commission's rules. The deadline for filing 
posthearing briefs is 5:15 p.m. on August 26, 2025. In addition, any 
person who has not entered an appearance as a party to the review may 
submit a written statement of information pertinent to the subject of 
the review on or before 5:15 p.m. on August 26, 2025. On September 24, 
2025, the Commission will make available to parties all information on 
which they have not had an opportunity to comment. Parties may submit 
final comments on this information on or before 5:15 p.m. on September 
26, 2025, but such final comments must not contain new factual 
information and must otherwise comply with section 207.68 of the 
Commission's rules. All written submissions must conform with the 
provisions of section 201.8 of the Commission's rules; any submissions 
that contain BPI must also conform with the requirements of sections 
201.6, 207.3, and 207.7 of the Commission's rules. The Commission's 
``Handbook on Filing Procedures'', available on the Commission's 
website at <a href="https://www.usitc.gov/documents/handbook_on_filing_procedures.pdf">https://www.usitc.gov/documents/handbook_on_filing_procedures.pdf</a>, elaborates upon the Commission's 
procedures with respect to filings.
    Additional written submissions to the Commission, including 
requests pursuant to section 201.12 of the Commission's rules, shall 
not be accepted unless good cause is shown for accepting such 
submissions, or unless the submission is pursuant to a specific request 
by a Commissioner or Commission staff.
    In accordance with sections 201.16(c) and 207.3 of the Commission's 
rules, each document filed by a party to the review must be served on 
all other parties to the review (as identified by either the public or 
BPI service list), and a certificate of service must be timely filed. 
The Secretary will not accept a document for filing without a 
certificate of service.
    The Commission has determined that this review is extraordinarily 
complicated and therefore has determined to exercise its authority to 
extend the review period by up to 90 days pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 
1675(c)(5)(B).
    Authority: This review is being conducted under authority of title 
VII of the Tariff Act of 1930; this notice is published pursuant to 
section 207.62 of the Commission's rules.

    By order of the Commission.

    Issued: March 20, 2025.
Lisa Barton,
Secretary to the Commission.
