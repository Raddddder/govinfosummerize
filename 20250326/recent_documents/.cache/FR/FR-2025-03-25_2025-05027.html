certain benefit rates and income limitations. These COLAs affect the 
Pension and Parents' DIC programs. The rate of the adjustment is tied 
to the increase in Social Security benefits effective December 1, 2024, 
as announced by the Social Security Administration (SSA). SSA has 
announced an increase of 2.5%.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Michael Holovacs, Management and 
Program Analyst, Pension and Fiduciary Service, Veterans Benefits 
Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs, 810 Vermont Avenue NW, 
Washington, DC 20420, 202-632-8863. (This is not a toll-free number.)

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 5312 and 
Public Law (Pub. L.) 95-588 sec. 306, VA is required to increase the 
benefit rates and income limitations in the Pension and Parents' DIC 
programs by the same percentage, and effective the same date, as 
increases in the benefit amounts payable under Title II of the Social 
Security Act. VA is required to publish the increased rates and income 
limitations in the Federal Register.
    The Social Security Administration announced a 2.5% COLA increase 
in Social Security benefits effective December 1, 2024. Therefore,

    DIC shall be paid monthly to parents of a deceased Veteran in the

    One parent (38 U.S.C. 1315(b)): If there is only one parent, the 
monthly rate of DIC paid to such parent shall be $819, reduced on the 
basis of the parent's annual income according to the following formula:
    For each $1 of annual income which is more than $0.00 but not more 
than $800, the $819 monthly rate shall not be reduced.
    For each $1 of annual income which is more than $800 but not more 
than $10,974, the monthly rate shall be reduced by $0.08.
    For each $1 of annual income which is more than $10,974, the 
monthly rate will not be reduced.
    No Parents' DIC is payable under this table if annual income 
exceeds $19,295.
    One parent who has remarried: If there is only one parent and the 
parent has remarried and is living with the parent's spouse, DIC shall 
be paid under 38 U.S.C. 1315(b) or under 38 U.S.C. 1315(d), whichever 
shall result in the greater benefit being paid to the Veteran's parent. 
In the case of remarriage, the total combined annual income of the 
parent and the parent's spouse shall be counted in determining the 
monthly rate of DIC.
    One of two parents not living with spouse (38 U.S.C. 1315(c)): The 
rates below apply to (1) two parents who are not living together, or 
(2) an unmarried parent when both parents are living and the other 
parent has remarried. The monthly rate of DIC paid to each such parent 
shall be $594 reduced on the basis of each parent's annual income, 
according to the following formula:
    For each $1 of annual income which is more than $0 but not more 
than $800, the $594 monthly rate shall not be reduced.
    For each $1 of annual income which is more than $800 but not more 
than $8,162, the monthly rate shall be reduced by $0.08.
    For each $1 of annual income which is more than $8,162, the monthly 
rate shall not be reduced.
    No Parents' DIC is payable under this table if annual income 
exceeds $19,295.
    One of two parents living with spouse or other parent (38 U.S.C. 
1315(d)): The rates below apply to each parent living with another 
parent; and each remarried parent, when both parents are alive. The 
monthly rate of DIC paid to such parents will be $560 reduced on the 
basis of the combined annual income of the two parents living together 
or the remarried parent or parents and spouse or spouses, as computed 
under the following formula:
    For each $1 of annual income which is more than $0 but not more 
than $1,000, the $560 monthly rate shall not be reduced.
    For each $1 of annual income which is more than $1,000 but not more 
than $7,937, the monthly rate shall be reduced by $0.08.
    For each $1 of annual income which is more than $7,937, the monthly 
rate shall not be reduced.
    No Parents' DIC is payable if the annual income exceeds $25,936.
    These rates are also applicable in the case of one surviving parent 
who has remarried, computed on the basis of the combined income of the 
parent and spouse, if this would be a greater benefit than that 
specified in the rates for 38 U.S.C. 1315(b) for one parent.
    Aid and attendance: The monthly rate of DIC payable to a parent per 
the guidelines above shall be increased by $445 if such parent is (1) a 
patient in a nursing home, or (2) helpless or blind, or so nearly 
helpless or blind as to need or require the regular aid and attendance 
of another person.
    Minimum rate: The monthly rate of DIC payable to any parent shall 
not be less than $5.
