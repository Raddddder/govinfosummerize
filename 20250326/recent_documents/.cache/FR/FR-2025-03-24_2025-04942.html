SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The Petitions
    On February 26, 2025, the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) 
received countervailing duty (CVD) petitions concerning imports of 
certain chassis and subassemblies thereof (chassis) from Mexico and 
Thailand filed in proper form on behalf of the U.S. Chassis 
Manufacturers Coalition (the petitioner),\1\ the members of which are 
domestic producers of chassis.\2\ The CVD Petitions were accompanied by 
antidumping duty (AD) petitions concerning imports of chassis from 
Mexico, Thailand, and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The members of the U.S. Chassis Manufacturers Coalition are 
Cheetah Chassis Corporation and Stoughton Trailers, LLC.
    \2\ See Petitioner's Letter, ``Petitions for the Imposition of 
Antidumping and Countervailing Duties,'' dated February 26, 2025 
(Petitions).
    \3\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Between February 28, and March 10, 2025, Commerce requested 
supplemental information pertaining to certain aspects of the Petitions 
in supplemental questionnaires.\4\ Between March 4 and 11, 2025, the 
petitioner filed timely responses to these requests for additional 
information.\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ See Commerce's Letters, ``Supplemental Questions,'' dated 
February 28, 2025 (First General Issues Questionnaire); see also 
Country-Specific Supplemental Questionnaires: Mexico Supplemental 
and Thailand Supplemental, dated March 3, 2025; Memorandum, ``Phone 
Call with Counsel to the Petitioner,'' dated March 7, 2025 (March 7, 
2025 Scope Memorandum); and Commerce's Letter, ``Supplemental 
Questions,'' dated March 10, 2025 (Third General Issues 
Questionnaire).
    \5\ See Petitioner's Letters, ``Petitioner Response to 1st 
Supplemental Questionnaire Regarding Common Issues and Injury Volume 
I of the Petition,'' dated March 4, 2025 (First General Issues 
Supplement); Country-Specific CVD Supplemental Responses: Mexico CVD 
Supplement, dated March 5, 2025; First Thailand CVD Supplement, 
dated March 7, 2025; and Second Thailand CVD Supplement, dated March 
10, 2025; ``Petitioner Response to 2nd Supplemental Questionnaire 
Regarding Common Issues and Injury Volume I of the Petition,'' dated 
March 10, 2025 (Second General Issues Supplement); and ``Petitioner 
Response to 3rd Supplemental Questionnaire Regarding Common Issues 
and Injury Volume I of the Petition,'' dated March 11, 2025 (Third 
General Issues Supplement). The petitioner also filed a supplement 
correcting a clerical error and providing a complete replacement of 
Exhibit I-13 of Volume I of the Petitions. See Petitioner's Letter, 
``Supplement to Exhibit I-13 of Volume I General Issues Petition,'' 
dated February 27, 2025 (Revised Exhibit I-13).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In accordance with section 702(b)(1) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as 
amended (the Act), the petitioner alleges that the Government of Mexico 
(GOM) and Government of Thailand (GOT) (collectively, Governments) are 
providing countervailable subsidies, within the meaning of sections 701 
and 771(5) of the Act, to producers of chassis in Mexico and Thailand, 
and that such imports are materially injuring, or threatening material 
injury to, the domestic industry producing chassis in the United 
States. Consistent with section 702(b)(1) of the Act and 19 CFR 
351.202(b), for those alleged programs on which we are initiating CVD 
investigations, the Petitions were accompanied by information 
reasonably available to the petitioner supporting its allegations.
    Commerce finds that the petitioner filed the Petitions on behalf of 
the domestic industry, because the petitioner is an interested party, 
as defined in section 771(9)(F) of the Act.\6\ Commerce also finds that 
the petitioner

[[Page 13453]]

demonstrated sufficient industry support with respect to the initiation 
of the requested CVD investigations.\7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ The members of the petitioning coalition are interested 
parties under section 771(9)(C) of the Act.
    \7\ See section on ``Determination of Industry Support for the 
Petitions,'' infra.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Periods of Investigation

    Because the Petitions were filed on February 26, 2025, the period 
of investigation for the Mexico and Thailand CVD investigations is 
January 1, 2024, through December 31, 2024.\8\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ See 19 CFR 351.204(b)(2).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scope of the Investigations

    The products covered by these investigations are chassis from 
Mexico and Thailand. For a full description of the scope of these 
investigations, see the appendix to this notice.

Comments on the Scope of the Investigations

    On February 28, and March 7, 2025, Commerce requested information 
and clarification from the petitioner regarding the proposed scope to 
ensure that the scope language in the Petition is an accurate 
reflection of the products for which the domestic industry is seeking 
relief.\9\ On March 4, and 10, 2025, the petitioner provided 
clarifications and revised the scope.\10\ The description of 
merchandise covered by these investigations, as described in the 
appendix to this notice, reflects these clarifications.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ See First General Issues Questionnaire; see also March 7, 
2025, Memorandum.
    \10\ See First General Issues Supplement at 2-6 and Exhibits I-
Supp-4 through I-Supp-6; see also Second General Issues Supplement 
at 1-8 and Exhibits I-Supp2-1 and I-Supp2-2.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As discussed in the Preamble to Commerce's regulations, we are 
setting aside a period for interested parties to raise issues regarding 
product coverage (i.e., scope).\11\ Commerce will consider all comments 
received from interested parties and, if necessary, will consult with 
interested parties prior to the issuance of the preliminary 
determinations. If scope comments include factual information, all such 
factual information should be limited to public information.\12\ 
Commerce requests that interested parties provide at the beginning of 
their scope comments a public executive summary for each comment or 
issue raised in their submission. Commerce further requests that 
interested parties limit their public executive summary of each comment 
or issue to no more than 450 words, not including citations. Commerce 
intends to use the public executive summaries as the basis of the 
comment summaries included in the analysis of scope comments. To 
facilitate preparation of its questionnaires, Commerce requests that 
scope comments be submitted by 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time (ET) on April 7, 
2025, which is 20 calendar days from the signature date of this notice. 
Any rebuttal comments, which may include factual information, and 
should also be limited to public information, must be filed by 5:00 
p.m. ET on April 17, 2025, which is 10 calendar days from the initial 
comment deadline.

    \12\ See 19 CFR 351.102(b)(21) (defining ``factual 
information'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Commerce requests that any factual information that parties 
consider relevant to the scope of these investigations be submitted 
during that time period. However, if a party subsequently finds that 
additional factual information pertaining to the scope of the 
investigations may be relevant, the party must contact Commerce and 
request permission to submit the additional information. All scope 
comments must be filed simultaneously on the records of the concurrent 
AD and CVD investigations.

Filing Requirements

    All submissions to Commerce must be filed electronically via 
Enforcement and Compliance's Antidumping Duty and Countervailing Duty 
Centralized Electronic Service System (ACCESS), unless an exception 
applies.\13\ An electronically filed document must be received 
successfully in its entirety by the time and date it is due.

Consultations

    Pursuant to sections 702(b)(4)(A)(i) and (ii) of the Act, Commerce 
notified the GOM and GOT of the receipt of the Petitions and provided 
an opportunity for consultations with respect to the Petition.\14\ 
Commerce held consultations with the GOM on March 14, 2025,\15\ and the 
GOT on March 12, 2025.\16\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Determination of Industry Support for the Petitions

    Section 702(b)(1) of the Act requires that a petition be filed on 
behalf of the domestic industry. Section 702(c)(4)(A) of the Act 
provides that a petition meets this requirement if the domestic 
producers or workers who support the petition account for: (i) at least 
25 percent of the total production of the domestic like product; and 
(ii) more than 50 percent of the production of the domestic like 
product produced by that portion of the industry expressing support 
for, or opposition to, the petition. Moreover, section 702(c)(4)(D) of 
the Act provides that, if the petition does not establish support of 
domestic producers or workers accounting for more than 50 percent of 
the total production of the domestic like product, Commerce shall: (i) 
poll the industry or rely on other information in order to determine if 
there is support for the petition, as required by subparagraph (A); or 
(ii) determine industry support using a statistically valid sampling 
method to poll the ``industry.''
    Section 771(4)(A) of the Act defines the ``industry'' as the 
producers as a whole of a domestic like product. Thus, to determine 
whether a petition has the requisite industry support, the statute 
directs Commerce to look to producers and workers who produce the 
domestic like product. The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC), 
which is responsible for determining whether ``the domestic industry'' 
has been injured, must also determine what constitutes a domestic like 
product in

[[Page 13454]]

order to define the industry. While both Commerce and the ITC apply the 
same statutory definition regarding the domestic like product,\19\ they 
do so for different purposes and pursuant to a separate and distinct 
authority. In addition, Commerce's determination is subject to 
limitations of time and information. Although this may result in 
different definitions of the like product, such differences do not 
render the decision of either agency contrary to law.\20\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \19\ See section 771(10) of the Act.
    \20\ See USEC, Inc. v. United States, 132 F. Supp. 2d 1, 8 (CIT 
2001) (citing Algoma Steel Corp., Ltd. v. United States, 688 F. 
Supp. 639, 644 (CIT 1988), aff'd Algoma Steel Corp., Ltd. v. United 
States, 865 F.2d 240 (Fed. Cir. 1989)).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Section 771(10) of the Act defines the domestic like product as ``a 
product which is like, or in the absence of like, most similar in 
characteristics and uses with, the article subject to an investigation 
under this title.'' Thus, the reference point from which the domestic 
like product analysis begins is ``the article subject to an 
investigation'' (i.e., the class or kind of merchandise to be 
investigated, which normally will be the scope as defined in the 
petition).
    With regard to the domestic like product, the petitioner does not 
offer a definition of the domestic like product distinct from the scope 
of the investigations.\21\ Based on our analysis of the information 
submitted on the record, we have determined that chassis, as defined in 
the scope, constitute a single domestic like product, and we have 
analyzed industry support in terms of that domestic like product.\22\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \21\ See Petition at Volume I (pages 22-26 and Exhibits I-3, I-
17, and I-18); see also First General Issues Supplement at 8-10; and 
Third General Issues Supplement at 1-4 and Exhibits I-Supp3-1 and I-
Supp3-2.
    \22\ For a discussion of the domestic like product analysis as 
applied to these cases and information regarding industry support, 
see Checklists, ``Countervailing Duty Investigation Initiation 
Checklists: Certain Chassis and Subassemblies Thereof from Mexico, 
Thailand, and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam,'' dated 
concurrently with, and hereby adopted by, this notice (Country-
Specific CVD Initiation Checklists), at Attachment II, Analysis of 
Industry Support for the Antidumping and Countervailing Duty 
Petitions Covering Certain Chassis and Subassemblies Thereof from 
Mexico, Thailand, and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (Attachment 
II). These checklists are on file electronically via ACCESS.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In determining whether the petitioner has standing under section 
702(c)(4)(A) of the Act, we considered the industry support data 
contained in the Petitions with reference to the domestic like product 
as defined in the ``Scope of the Investigations,'' in the appendix to 
this notice. To establish industry support, the petitioner provided the 
2024 production of the domestic like product for the U.S. producers 
that support the Petitions and compared this to the estimated total 
production of the domestic like product in 2024 by the entire U.S. 
chassis industry.\23\ We relied on data provided by the petitioner for 
purposes of measuring industry support.\24\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \23\ Id.
    \24\ For further discussion, see Attachment II of the Country-
Specific CVD Initiation Checklists.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Our review of the data provided in the Petitions, the First General 
Issues Supplement, and other information readily available to Commerce 
indicates that the petitioner has established industry support for the 
Petitions.\25\ First, the Petitions established support from domestic 
producers (or workers) accounting for more than 50 percent of the total 
production of the domestic like product and, as such, Commerce is not 
required to take further action in order to evaluate industry support 
(e.g., polling).\26\ Second, the domestic producers (or workers) have 
met the statutory criteria for industry support under section 
702(c)(4)(A)(i) of the Act because the domestic producers (or workers) 
who support the Petitions account for at least 25 percent of the total 
production of the domestic like product.\27\ Finally, the domestic 
producers (or workers) have met the statutory criteria for industry 
support under section 702(c)(4)(A)(ii) of the Act because the domestic 
producers (or workers) who support the Petitions account for more than 
50 percent of the production of the domestic like product produced by 
that portion of the industry expressing support for, or opposition to, 
the Petitions.\28\ Accordingly, Commerce determines that the Petitions 
were filed on behalf of the domestic industry within the meaning of 
section 702(b)(1) of the Act.\29\

    \29\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Injury Test

    Because Mexico and Thailand are ``Subsidies Agreement Countries'' 
within the meaning of section 701(b) of the Act, section 701(a)(2) of 
the Act applies to these investigations. Accordingly, the ITC must 
determine whether imports of the subject merchandise from Mexico and/or 
Thailand materially injure, or threaten material injury to, a U.S. 
industry.

Allegations and Evidence of Material Injury and Causation

    The petitioner alleges that imports of the subject merchandise are 
benefiting from countervailable subsidies and that such imports are 
causing, or threaten to cause, material injury to the U.S. industry 
producing the domestic like product. In addition, the petitioner 
alleges that subject imports from Mexico and Thailand exceed the 
negligibility threshold provided for under section 771(24)(A) of the 
Act.\30\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \30\ For further information regarding negligibility and the 
injury allegation, see Country-Specific CVD Initiation Checklists at 
Attachment III, Analysis of Allegations and Evidence of Material 
Injury and Causation for the Antidumping Duty and Countervailing 
Duty Petitions Covering Certain Chassis and Subassemblies Thereof 
from Mexico, Thailand, and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam 
(Attachment III).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The petitioner contends that the industry's injured condition is 
illustrated by the significant increase in the volumes of subject 
imports; reduced market share; underselling and price depression and/or 
suppression; lost sales and revenues; declines in domestic producers' 
U.S. shipments, production, and capacity utilization; decline in 
employment variables; adverse impact on financial performance; and 
negative impact on the existing development and production efforts of 
the domestic industry.\31\ We assessed the allegations and supporting 
evidence regarding material injury, threat of material injury, 
causation, cumulation, as well as negligibility, and we have determined 
that these allegations are properly supported by adequate evidence and 
meet the statutory requirements for initiation.\32\

Initiation of CVD Investigations

    Based upon the examination of the Petitions and supplemental 
responses, we find that they meet the requirements of section 702 of 
the Act. Therefore, we are initiating CVD investigations to determine 
whether imports of chassis from Mexico and Thailand benefit from 
countervailable subsidies conferred by the GOM and GOT, respectively. 
In accordance with section 703(b)(1) of the Act and 19 CFR 
351.205(b)(1), unless postponed, we will make our preliminary 
determinations no later than 65 days after the date of this initiation.

Mexico

    Based on our review of the Petitions, we find that there is 
sufficient information to initiate a CVD investigation on 19 of the 19 
programs

[[Page 13455]]

alleged by the petitioner. For a full discussion of the basis for our 
decision to initiate on each program, see the Mexico CVD Initiation 
Checklist. A public version of the initiation checklist for this 
investigation is available on ACCESS.

Thailand

    Based on our review of the Petitions, we find that there is 
sufficient information to initiate a CVD investigation on 20 of the 20 
programs alleged by the petitioner. For a full discussion of the basis 
for our decision to initiate on each program, see the Thailand CVD 
Initiation Checklist. A public version of the initiation checklist for 
this investigation is available on ACCESS.

Respondent Selection

    In the Petitions, the petitioner identified 13 companies in Mexico 
and three companies in Thailand as producers and/or exporters of 
chassis.\33\ Commerce intends to follow its standard practice in CVD 
investigations and calculate company-specific subsidy rates in these 
investigations. In the event that Commerce determines that the number 
of companies is large and it cannot individually examine each company 
based on Commerce's resources, Commerce normally selects mandatory 
respondents in CVD investigations using U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection (CBP) entry data for U.S. imports under the appropriate 
Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) subheading(s) 
listed in the ``Scope of the Investigations'' in the appendix. However, 
for these investigations, the main HTSUS subheadings under which the 
subject merchandise would enter (8716.39.0090 and 8716.90.5060) are 
basket categories under which non-subject merchandise may also enter. 
Therefore, instead of relying on CBP entry data in selecting 
respondents, we intend to issue quantity and value (Q&V) questionnaires 
to each potential respondent for which there is complete address 
information on the record.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \33\ See Petitions at Volume I (page 18 and Exhibit I-13); see 
also Revised Exhibit I-13; and First General Issues Supplement at 1-
2 and Exhibits I-Supp-1 and I-Supp-17.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Commerce will post the Q&V questionnaires along with filing 
instructions on Commerce's website at <a href="https://www.trade.gov/ec-adcvd-case-announcements">https://www.trade.gov/ec-adcvd-case-announcements</a>. Producers/exporters of chassis from Mexico and 
Thailand that do not receive Q&V questionnaires may still submit a 
response to the Q&V questionnaire and can obtain a copy of the Q&V 
questionnaire from Commerce's website. Responses to the Q&V 
questionnaire must be submitted by the relevant producers/exporters no 
later than 5:00 p.m. ET on April 1, 2025, which is two weeks from the 
signature date of this notice. All Q&V questionnaire responses must be 
filed electronically via ACCESS. An electronically filed document must 
be received successfully, in its entirety, by ACCESS no later than 5:00 
p.m. ET on the deadline noted above.
    Interested parties must submit applications for disclosure under 
administrative protective order (APO) in accordance with 19 CFR 
351.305(b). Instructions for filing such applications may be found on 
Commerce's website at <a href="https://www.trade.gov/administrative-protective-orders">https://www.trade.gov/administrative-protective-orders</a>.

Distribution of Copies of the Petitions

    In accordance with section 702(b)(4)(A) of the Act and 19 CFR 
351.202(f), a copy of the public version of the Petitions has been 
provided to the GOM and GOT via ACCESS. To the extent practicable, we 
will attempt to provide a copy of the public version of the Petitions 
to each exporter named in the Petitions, as provided under 19 CFR 
351.203(c)(2).

ITC Notification

    Commerce will notify the ITC of its initiation, as required by 
section 702(d) of the Act.

Preliminary Determinations by the ITC

    The ITC will preliminarily determine, within 45 days after the date 
on which the Petitions were filed, whether there is a reasonable 
indication that imports of chassis from Mexico and/or Thailand are 
materially injuring, or threatening material injury to, a U.S. 
industry.\34\ A negative ITC determination for either country will 
result in the investigation being terminated with respect to that 
country.\35\ Otherwise, these CVD investigations will proceed according 
to statutory and regulatory time limits.

Submission of Factual Information

    Factual information is defined in 19 CFR 351.102(b)(21) as: (i) 
evidence submitted in response to questionnaires; (ii) evidence 
submitted in support of allegations; (iii) publicly available 
information to value factors of production under 19 CFR 351.408(c) or 
to measure the adequacy of remuneration under 19 CFR 351.511(a)(2); 
(iv) evidence placed on the record by Commerce; and (v) evidence other 
than factual information described in (i)-(iv). Section 351.301(b) of 
Commerce's regulations requires any party, when submitting factual 
information, to specify under which subsection of 19 CFR 351.102(b)(21) 
the information is being submitted \36\ and, if the information is 
submitted to rebut, clarify, or correct factual information already on 
the record, to provide an explanation identifying the information 
already on the record that the factual information seeks to rebut, 
clarify, or correct.\37\ Time limits for the submission of factual 
information are addressed in 19 CFR 351.301, which provides specific 
time limits based on the type of factual information being submitted. 
Interested parties should review the regulations prior to submitting 
factual information in these investigations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \36\ See 19 CFR 351.301(b).
    \37\ See 19 CFR 351.301(b)(2).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Time Limits for Submission of Factual Information in Response to 
Questionnaires

    Section 351.301(c) of Commerce's regulations states that during a 
proceeding, Commerce may issue to any person questionnaires, which 
includes both and initial and supplemental questionnaires. For all 
investigations initiated after January 15, 2025, the following time 
limits apply: \38\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \38\ See 19 CFR 351.301(c)(1)(i)-(v).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (i) Initial questionnaire responses are due 30 days from the date 
of receipt of such questionnaire. The time limit for response to 
individual sections of the questionnaire, if Commerce requests a 
separate response to such sections, may be less than the 30 days 
allotted for response to the full questionnaire. In general, the date 
of receipt will be considered to be seven days from the date on which 
the initial questionnaire was transmitted.
    (ii) Supplemental questionnaire responses are due on the date 
specified by Commerce.
    (iii) A notification by an interested party, under section 
782(c)(1) of the Act, of difficulties in submitting information in 
response to a questionnaire issued by Commerce is to be submitted in 
writing within 14 days after the date of the questionnaire or, if the 
questionnaire is due in 14 days or less, within the time specified by 
Commerce.
    (iv) A respondent interested party may request in writing that 
Commerce conduct a questionnaire presentation. Commerce may conduct a 
questionnaire presentation if Commerce notifies the government of the 
affected country and that government does not object.

[[Page 13456]]

    (v) Factual information submitted to rebut, clarify, or correct 
questionnaire responses. Within 14 days after an initial questionnaire 
response and within 10 days after a supplemental questionnaire response 
has been filed with Commerce, an interested party other than the 
original submitter is permitted one opportunity to submit factual 
information to rebut, clarify, or correct factual information contained 
in the questionnaire response. Within seven days of the filing of such 
rebuttal, clarification, or correction to a questionnaire response, the 
original submitter of the questionnaire response is permitted one 
opportunity to submit factual information to rebut, clarify, or correct 
factual information submitted in the interested party's rebuttal, 
clarification or correction. Commerce will reject any untimely filed 
rebuttal, clarification, or correction submission and provide, to the 
extent practicable, written notice stating the reasons for rejection. 
If insufficient time remains before the due date for the final 
determination or final results of review, Commerce may specify shorter 
deadlines under this section.

Extensions of Time Limits

    Parties may request an extension of time limits before the 
expiration of a time limit established under 19 CFR 351.301, or as 
otherwise specified by Commerce. In general, an extension request will 
be considered untimely if it is filed after the expiration of the time 
limit established under 19 CFR 351.301, or as otherwise specified by 
Commerce.\39\ For submissions that are due from multiple parties 
simultaneously, an extension request will be considered untimely if it 
is filed after 10:00 a.m. ET on the due date. Under certain 
circumstances, Commerce may elect to specify a different time limit by 
which extension requests will be considered untimely for submissions 
which are due from multiple parties simultaneously. In such a case, we 
will inform parties in a letter or memorandum of the deadline 
(including a specified time) by which extension requests must be filed 
to be considered timely. An extension request must be made in a 
separate, standalone submission; under limited circumstances we will 
grant untimely filed requests for the extension of time limits, where 
we determine, based on 19 CFR 351.302, that extraordinary circumstances 
exist. Parties should review Commerce's regulations concerning the 
extension of time limits and the Time Limits Final Rule prior to 
submitting factual information in these investigations.\40\

Appendix

Scope of the Investigations

    The merchandise covered by these investigations consists of 
chassis and subassemblies thereof, whether finished or unfinished, 
whether assembled or unassembled, whether coated or uncoated, 
regardless of the number of axles, for carriage of containers, or 
other payloads (including self-supporting payloads) for road, marine 
roll-on/roll-off (RORO) and/or rail transport. Chassis are 
typically, but are not limited to, rectangular framed trailers with 
a suspension and axle system, wheels and tires, brakes, a lighting 
and electrical system, a coupling for towing behind a truck tractor, 
and a locking system or systems to secure the shipping container or 
containers to the chassis using twistlocks, slide pins or similar 
attachment devices to engage the corner fittings on the container or 
other payload.
    Subject merchandise includes, but is not limited to, the 
following subassemblies:
    <bullet> Chassis frames, or sections of chassis frames, 
including kingpin assemblies, bolsters consisting of transverse 
beams with locking or support mechanisms, goosenecks, drop 
assemblies, extension mechanisms and/or rear impact guards;
    <bullet> Running gear assemblies or axle assemblies for 
connection to the chassis frame, whether fixed in nature or capable 
of sliding fore and aft or lifting up and lowering down, which may 
or may not include suspension(s) (mechanical or pneumatic), wheel 
end components, slack adjusters, dressed axles, brake chambers, 
locking pins, and tires and wheels; and
    <bullet> Assemblies that connect to the chassis frame or a 
section of the chassis frame, such as but not limited to, pintle 
hooks or B-trains (which include a fifth wheel), which are capable 
of connecting a chassis to a converter dolly or another chassis.
    Importation of any of these subassemblies, whether assembled or 
unassembled, constitutes an unfinished chassis for purposes of these 
investigations.
    Subject merchandise also includes chassis, whether finished or 
unfinished, entered with components such as, but not limited to: hub 
and drum assemblies, brake assemblies (either drum or disc), bare 
axles, brake chambers, suspensions and suspension components, wheel 
end components, landing gear legs, spoke or disc wheels, tires, 
brake control systems, electrical harnesses and lighting systems.
    Processing of finished and unfinished chassis and components 
such as trimming, cutting, grinding, notching, punching, drilling, 
painting, coating, staining, finishing, assembly, or any other 
processing either in the country of manufacture of the in-scope 
product or in a third country does not remove the product from the 
scope. Inclusion of other components not identified as comprising 
the finished or unfinished chassis does not remove the product from 
the scope.
    Individual components entered and sold by themselves are not 
subject to the investigations, but components entered with a 
finished or unfinished chassis are subject merchandise. A finished 
chassis is ultimately comprised of several different types of 
subassemblies. Within each subassembly there are numerous components 
that comprise a given subassembly.
    This scope excludes dry van trailers, refrigerated van trailers 
and flatbed trailers. Dry van trailers are trailers with a wholly 
enclosed cargo space comprised of fixed sides, nose, floor and roof, 
with articulated panels (doors) across the rear and occasionally at 
selected places on the sides, with the cargo space being permanently 
incorporated in the trailer itself. Refrigerated van trailers are 
trailers with a wholly enclosed cargo space comprised of fixed 
sides, nose, floor and roof, with articulated panels (doors) across 
the rear and occasionally at selected places on the sides, with the 
cargo space being permanently

[[Page 13457]]

incorporated in the trailer and being insulated, possessing specific 
thermal properties intended for use with self-contained 
refrigeration systems. Flatbed (or platform) trailers consist of 
load carrying main frames and a solid, flat or stepped loading deck 
or floor permanently incorporated with and supported by frame rails 
and cross members.
    The finished and unfinished chassis subject to these 
investigations are typically classified in the Harmonized Tariff 
Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) at subheadings: 8716.39.0090 
and 8716.90.5060. Imports of finished and unfinished chassis may 
also enter under HTSUS subheading 8716.90.5010. While the HTSUS 
subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes, the 
written description of the merchandise under investigation is 
dispositive.
