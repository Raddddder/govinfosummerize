Nuclear Regulatory Commission

Docket Nos. 72-29, 50-277, and 50-278

Constellation Energy Generation, LLC; Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station 
Units 2 and 3; Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation

I. Background

    Constellation Energy Generation, LLC (CEG) is the holder of renewed 
facility operating license Nos. DPR-44 and DPR-56, which authorize 
operation of the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station (PB) Units 2 and 3 
in Delta, Pennsylvania, under Title 10 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations (10 CFR) Part 50, ``Domestic Licensing of Production and 
Utilization Facilities.'' The licenses provide, among other things, 
that the facility is subject to all rules, regulations, and orders of 
the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) now or hereafter in 
effect.
    Consistent with 10 CFR part 72, subpart K, ``General License for 
Storage of Spent Fuel at Power Reactor Sites,'' a general license is 
issued for the storage of spent fuel in an independent spent fuel 
storage installation (ISFSI) at power reactor sites to persons 
authorized to possess or operate nuclear power reactors under 10 CFR 
part 50. CEG is authorized to operate nuclear power reactors under 10 
CFR part 50 and holds a 10 CFR part 72 general license for storage of 
spent fuel at the PB ISFSI. Under the terms of the general license, CEG 
stores spent fuel at its PB ISFSI using the HI-STORM Flood/Wind (FW) 
Multi-Purpose Canister (MPC) Storage System in accordance with 
Certificate of Compliance (CoC) No. 1032, Amendment No. 1, Revision No. 
1.

II. Request/Action

    By a letter dated January 24, 2025 (Agencywide Documents Access and 
Management System (ADAMS) Accession Number No. ML25024A148), as 
supplemented on February 4, 2025 (ML25036A335), CEG requested an 
exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR 72.212(a)(2), 72.212(b)(3), 
72.212(b)(5)(i), 72.212(b)(11), and 72.214 that require PB to comply 
with the terms, conditions, and specifications of CoC No. 1032, 
Amendment No. 1, Revision No. 1 (ML15152A358). If approved, CEG's 
exemption request would accordingly allow PB to load seven MPC-89 at 
the PB ISFSI site in a near-term loading campaign beginning in June 
2025, in the HI-STORM FW MPC system, including the use of the HI-TRAC 
VW transfer cask (HI-TRAC) during loading and transport operations, 
where the terms, conditions, and specifications in CoC No. 1032, 
Amendment No. 1, Revision No. 1 are not met.
    Before using a CoC, general licensees are required to perform a 
site-specific evaluation to establish that, once loaded with spent 
fuel, the cask will conform to the terms, conditions, and 
specifications of the CoC, including following the NRC-approved final 
safety analysis report (FSAR) methodology. CEG currently uses the HI-
STORM FW MPC Storage System under CoC No. 1032, Amendment No. 1, 
Revision No. 1, for dry storage of spent nuclear fuel in MPC-89 at the 
PB ISFSI. The HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System CoC provides the 
requirements, conditions, and operating limits necessary for use of the 
system to store spent fuel. One of the operating limits established in 
the CoC involves potential tornado-generated missile impacts. The HI-
STORM FW FSAR table 2.2.5 evaluates a generic set of tornado-generated 
missile impacts (ML24327A229). CEG discovered that PB's site-specific 
analysis performed to demonstrate

[[Page 13504]]

protection of the loaded MPC-89, while in the HI-TRAC, against tornado-
generated missiles was not performed consistent with the NRC-approved 
method of evaluation in the FSAR. Contrary to CEG's site specific 
analysis, the NRC-approved evaluation in the FSAR does not take credit 
for the missile resistance offered by the HI-TRAC water jacket shell, 
and assumes that the small and intermediate missiles will penetrate the 
water jacket shell with no energy loss.
    Therefore, CEG requests this exemption to allow it to conduct the 
planned loading and transport operations of the seven MPC-89 in the HI-
STORM FW MPC Storage System at PB ISFSI beginning in June 2025, even 
though, because of the different tornado-generated missile analysis of 
the HI-TRAC in PB's site specific review, the terms, conditions, and 
specifications of the CoC will not be met.

III. Discussion

    Pursuant to 10 CFR 72.7, ``Specific exemptions,'' the Commission 
may, upon application by any interested person or upon its own 
initiative, grant such exemptions from the requirements of the 
regulations of 10 CFR part 72 as it determines are authorized by law 
and will not endanger life or property or the common defense and 
security and are otherwise in the public interest.

A. The Exemption Is Authorized by Law

    This exemption would allow CEG to use the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage 
System, including the use of the HI-TRAC during loading and transport 
operations, for seven MPC-89 at its PB ISFSI, beginning in June 2025, 
where the terms, conditions, and specifications in CoC No. 1032, 
Amendment No. 1, Revision No. 1, are not met. CEG is requesting an 
exemption from the provisions in 10 CFR part 72 that require the 
licensee to comply with the terms, conditions, and specifications of 
the CoC for the approved cask model it uses. Section 72.7 allows the 
NRC to grant exemptions from the requirements of 10 CFR part 72. This 
authority to grant exemptions is consistent with the Atomic Energy Act 
of 1954, as amended, and is not otherwise inconsistent with the NRC's 
regulations or other applicable laws. Additionally, no other law 
prohibits the activities that would be authorized by the exemption. 
Therefore, the NRC concludes that there is no statutory prohibition on 
the issuance of the requested exemption, and the NRC is authorized to 
grant the exemption by law.

B. The Exemption Will Not Endanger Life or Property or the Common 
Defense and Security

    CEG is requesting an exemption to use the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage 
System, including the use of the HI-TRAC during loading and transport 
operations for seven MPC-89 at the PB ISFSI, beginning in June 2025, 
where the terms, conditions, and specifications in CoC No. 1032, 
Amendment No. 1, Revision No. 1, are not met. In support of its 
exemption request, CEG asserts that issuance of the exemption would not 
endanger life or property because the evaluation of PB's postulated 
tornado-generated missiles demonstrates that all FSAR acceptance 
criteria are met. According to CEG, the site-specific analysis follows 
the same mathematical approach as the generic approach in the FSAR but 
takes credit for the additional resistance provided by the HI-TRAC 
water jacket shell. Additionally, CEG notes that the water jacket shell 
is an Important-to-Safety (ITS) component and meets all the criteria as 
analyzed. Therefore, CEG contends the site-specific analysis, although 
different from the FSAR methodology, demonstrates that the loading and 
transport operations of the system using the HI-TRAC provides adequate 
protection against PB's design basis tornado-generated missiles. As 
such, according to CEG, the proposed exemption does not endanger life 
or property or the common defense and security.
    The NRC staff reviewed the requested exemption and determined that 
the request does not change the fundamental design, components, or 
safety features of the storage system. The NRC staff evaluated the 
applicable potential safety impacts of granting the exemption to assess 
the potential for any danger to life or property or the common defense 
and security. Specifically, the NRC staff reviewed the applicant's 
structural, confinement, thermal, criticality, shielding, and radiation 
protection evaluations for the proposed exemption.
    Structural and Confinement Review for the Requested Exemption: The 
staff noted that this exemption does not involve any change to the 
physical design or construction of the HI-STORM FW overpack, HI-TRAC, 
or MPC-89, nor to any operating procedures. Instead, the exemption is 
to allow the use of the CoC system despite the different methodology 
used by PB regarding the tornado-generated missile impact analysis than 
that approved by the NRC and reflected in the CoC FSAR. Therefore, the 
staff's structural review focused on the analysis and methodology 
followed to demonstrate that the design of the MPC-89 and the HI-TRAC 
can withstand the governing PB site-specific tornado-generated missile 
impact without impairing their capability to perform their intended 
functions. The MPC and the HI-TRAC are deemed to perform their intended 
design functions if the following performance objectives, as described 
in HI-STORM FW FSAR section 3.1.2 (ML24327A229), can be satisfied:
    (i) The postulated tornado generated missiles do not compromise the 
integrity of the MPC confinement boundary while the MPC is contained 
within the HI-TRAC.
    (ii) No geometry changes occur under the postulated tornado-
generated missiles impact during handling conditions that may preclude 
ready retrievability of the contained MPC.
    (iii) The radiation shielding remains properly positioned under all 
applicable handling service conditions for the HI-TRAC.
    In general, the above performance objectives are deemed to be 
satisfied for the MPC and the HI-TRAC if (1) the missile does not 
penetrate the inner shell of the HI-TRAC, MPC or MPC lid, and does not 
breach the confinement boundary, (2) the stresses (stress intensities 
or strains, as applicable) calculated by the appropriate structural 
analyses are less than the allowable defined in FSAR subsection 
3.1.2.3, and (3) the geometry change in the HI-TRAC, if any, after any 
event of structural consequence to the transfer cask, does not preclude 
ready retrievability of the contained MPC.
    The HI-TRAC body consists of two main layers: a water jacket layer 
and a lead shield layer. Each layer is contained within different steel 
shells: the water jacket shell (outermost shell of HI-TRAC), the outer 
shell of the lead shield layer (between the water jacket layer and a 
lead shield layer), and the inner shell (innermost shell of the lead 
shield layer and the HI-TRAC). The proprietary Holtec Report HI-
2135869, ``Site-Specific Tornado Missile Analysis for HI-STORM FW 
System,'' Revision No. 9, generically addresses the HI-TRAC structural 
responses due to bounding site-specific small and intermediate tornado-
generated missile strikes, except for the governing tornado-generated 
missile for PB, which is a 4-inch x 12-inch x 12-foot-long wooden plank 
with an impact velocity of 300 miles per hour (mph). In support of this 
exemption request, Holtec's ``HI-STORM FW Calculation Package to 
Support Exemptions'' (PB site-specific analysis, ML25021A244) further

[[Page 13505]]

analyzed the governing site-specific wooden plank missile using the 
same energy balance approach and assumptions relating to the missile 
behavior and kinetic energy as other evaluated tornado-generated 
missiles, with the exception of the credit given in the analysis for 
the resistance provided by the HI-TRAC water jacket shell. Based on 
this analysis, CEG concluded that the HI-TRAC inner shell is not 
penetrated and is sufficient to absorb the remaining kinetic energy of 
the wooden plank. Therefore, CEG concludes that the site-specific 
governing tornado-generated missile does not penetrate the MPC-89 
confinement boundary, and no significant deformation of the HI-TRAC is 
expected that would prevent the MPC-89 from being retrieved or 
maintaining shielding effectiveness.
    The staff reviewed the sizes, mass, and velocities of the site-
specific tornado-generated missiles analyzed in the PB site-specific 
analysis and verified that the analyzed tornado-generated missiles 
bound the design basis tornado-generated missile spectrum specified in 
section C.2.4 of the PB updated final safety analysis report, Appendix 
C (ML23173A057). The staff's independent analysis of the missile 
penetration by the wooden plank concluded that a greater margin of 
safety is available for the inner shell penetration than the one 
calculated in the PB site-specific analysis. Furthermore, based on the 
review of the PB site-specific analysis, the staff finds that the 
missile penetration depth by the wooden plank in the MPC lid remains 
less than the minimum thickness of the MPC closure lid. Additionally, 
the calculated global stress intensities for the HI-TRAC shell due to 
the missile strike satisfy American Society of Mechanical Engineers, 
Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section III, Division 1, Subsection 
NF, Level D limits, as specified in the HI-STORM FW FSAR section 
3.1.2.3. Therefore, in the event of a tornado-generated missile impact 
from the wooden plank analyzed, damage to the cask or canister that 
compromise confinement boundary, global plastic deformation in the cask 
shell, or ovaling of the cask inner cavity, is not anticipated, and 
will not affect the overall shielding effectiveness of the cask and the 
retrievability of the MPC. The staff also noted that the analysis 
results are conservative since they assume that the wooden plank is 
rigid, and no kinetic energy dissipation is being credited due to 
deformation of the wooden plank when it strikes the HI-TRAC at high 
velocity.
    Based on the staff's review of the analysis provided for the 
exemption request, the staff finds the proposed methodology used for 
the PB site-specific missile penetration analysis acceptable and 
concludes that the site-specific analysis demonstrates that the MPC and 
HI-TRAC can withstand the governing site-specific tornado-generated 
missile impact without compromising their ability to perform their 
intended safety functions at PB.
    Thermal Review for the Requested Exemption: The thermal 
consequences of a complete loss of water due to rupture of the HI-TRAC 
water jacket from a tornado-generated missile has been analyzed in FSAR 
sections 4.6 and 12.2.6.2 (ML24327A229). It demonstrates that the 
consequences are within the short-term fuel cladding and material 
temperature limits. The revised analysis with credit for the HI-TRAC 
water jacket shell demonstrates that the FSAR acceptance criteria 
continue to be met, and a complete loss of water continues to be 
bounding for thermal evaluation. Therefore, no further thermal 
evaluation is required to support this exemption request.
    Criticality and Shielding Review for the Requested Exemption: A 
complete loss of water due to rupture of the HI-TRAC water jacket from 
a tornado-generated missile has been analyzed for shielding and no 
effect on criticality control features as stated in FSAR section 
12.2.6.2 (ML24327A229). The revised analysis with credit for the HI-
TRAC water jacket shell demonstrates that the FSAR acceptance criteria 
continue to be met, and a complete loss of water continues to be 
bounding for the shielding evaluation. Therefore, no further 
criticality and shielding review is required to support this exemption 
request.
    Radiation Protection Review for the Requested Exemption: There is 
no degradation in confinement capabilities of the MPC when inside of 
the HI-TRAC. The local dose rates of a complete loss of water due to 
rupture of the HI-TRAC water jacket from a tornado-generated missile 
has been analyzed in FSAR chapter 5 (ML24327A229). The revised analysis 
with credit for the HI-TRAC water jacket shell demonstrates that the 
FSAR acceptance criteria continue to be met, and a complete loss of 
water continues to be bounding for radiation protection. The necessary 
compensatory measures continue to be valid. Therefore, no further 
radiation protection review is required to support this exemption 
request.
    Conclusion: Based on staff's analysis of the structural and 
confinement review, and the otherwise bounding nature of the FSAR's 
analysis in other areas, the NRC staff has concluded that under the 
requested exemption, the storage system will continue to meet the 
safety requirements of 10 CFR part 72 and the offsite dose limits of 10 
CFR part 20 and, therefore, will not endanger life or property or the 
common defense and security.

C. The Exemption Is Otherwise in the Public Interest

    The proposed exemption would allow CEG to use the HI-STORM FW MPC 
Storage System, including the use of the HI-TRAC solely during loading 
and transport operations for seven MPC-89 at PB ISFSI, beginning in 
June 2025, even though PB's tornado-generated missile analysis of HI-
TRAC, which takes credit for the water jacket shell, is not part of the 
NRC-approved CoC No. 1032, Amendment No. 1, Revision No. 1. According 
to CEG, the exemption is in the public interest because being unable to 
load fuel into dry storage in the future loading campaign would impact 
CEG's ability to offload fuel from the PB reactor, consequently 
impacting continued safe reactor operation.
    CEG states that not being able to use the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage 
System, including the use of the HI-TRAC during loading and transport 
operations for seven MPC-89 at the PB ISFSI in the June 2025 loading 
campaign, would impact its ability to effectively manage the margin to 
full core discharge capacity (FCDC) in the PB Units 2 and 3 spent fuel 
pools (SFP). The low FCDC margin makes it difficult to stage a complete 
reload batch of fuel in the SFPs in preparation for outages and 
presents a potential reactivity management risk to fuel handling 
operations during pre- and post-outage activities. In addition, 
according to CEG, a crowded spent fuel pool would challenge the decay 
heat removal demand of the pool and increase the likelihood of a loss 
of fuel pool cooling event and a fuel handling accident. Furthermore, 
CEG contends that PB planned the cask loading campaign years in advance 
based on availability of the specialized work force and equipment that 
is shared throughout the CEG fleet. These specialty resources support 
competing activities and priorities, including fuel pool cleanouts and 
refueling outages. Therefore, CEG asserts that the available windows to 
complete the cask loading campaigns are limited, and any delays would 
have a cascading impact on other scheduled specialized activities.

[[Page 13506]]

    For the reasons described by CEG in the exemption request, the NRC 
staff agree that it is in the public interest to grant the exemption. 
If the exemption is not granted, in order to comply with the CoC, CEG 
would have to keep spent fuel in the spent fuel pool if it is not 
permitted to use the HI-TRAC during loading and transport operations 
for seven MPC-89 at the PB ISFSI for the loading campaign beginning in 
June 2025, thus impacting PB's ability to effectively manage the FCDC 
margin. Moreover, should spent fuel pool capacity be reached, the 
ability to refuel the operating reactor unit is challenged, thus 
potentially impacting continued reactor operations.
    Therefore, the staff concludes that approving the exemption is in 
the public interest.
Environmental Consideration
    The NRC staff also considered whether there would be any 
significant environmental impacts associated with the exemption. For 
this proposed action, the NRC staff performed an environmental 
assessment pursuant to 10 CFR 51.30. The environmental assessment 
concluded that the proposed action would not significantly impact the 
quality of the human environment. The NRC staff concluded that the 
proposed action would not result in any changes in the types or amounts 
of any radiological or non-radiological effluents that may be released 
offsite, and there would be no significant increase in occupational or 
public radiation exposure because of the proposed action. The 
environmental assessment and the finding of no significant impact was 
published on March 6, 2025 (90 FR 11440).

IV. Conclusion

    Based on these considerations, the NRC has determined that, 
pursuant to 10 CFR 72.7, the exemption is authorized by law, will not 
endanger life or property or the common defense and security, and is 
otherwise in the public interest. Therefore, the NRC grants CEG an 
exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR 72.212(a)(2), 72.212(b)(3), 
72.212(b)(5)(i), 72.212(b)(11), and 72.214 solely with respect to the 
planned loading and transport operations for seven MPC-89 at PB ISFSI 
for the loading campaign beginning in June 2025.
    This exemption is effective upon issuance.

    Dated: March 6, 2025.
