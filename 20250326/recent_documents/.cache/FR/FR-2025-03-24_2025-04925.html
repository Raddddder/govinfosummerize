II. Background

    To help us carry out our conservation responsibilities for affected 
species, and in consideration of section 10(c) of the Endangered 
Species Act of 1973, as amended (ESA; 16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.), we 
invite public comments on permit applications before final action is 
taken. With some exceptions, the ESA prohibits certain activities with 
listed species unless Federal authorization is issued that allows such 
activities. Permits issued under section 10(a)(1)(A) of the ESA allow 
otherwise prohibited activities for scientific purposes or to enhance 
the propagation or survival of the affected species. Service 
regulations regarding prohibited activities with
