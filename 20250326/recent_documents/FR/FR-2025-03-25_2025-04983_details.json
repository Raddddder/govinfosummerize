  "summary": "The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2023-02-06, which applies to all BAE Systems (Operations) Limited Model 4101 airplanes. AD 2023-02-06 requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. Since the FAA issued AD 2023-02-06, the FAA has determined that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This proposed AD would continue to require certain actions in AD 2023-02-06 and require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.",
