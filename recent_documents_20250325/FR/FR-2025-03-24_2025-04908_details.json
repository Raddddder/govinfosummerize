  "summary": "The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is reopening the public comment period on the proposed rule entitled \"Air Plan Approval; AK, Fairbanks North Star Borough; 2006 24-hour PM<INF>2.5</INF> Serious Area and 189(d) Plan\" published on January 8, 2025. Commenters requested more time to review the proposal and prepare comments. In response, the EPA is providing an additional 30 days for the public to provide comment on all aspects of the proposed rule. The January 8, 2025, notice of proposed rulemaking also started the EPA's adequacy process for the motor vehicle emissions budgets and began the public comment period for that process. The EPA is not reopening the public comment period for the adequacy process, and it intends to proceed with the adequacy process outside of this rulemaking.",
