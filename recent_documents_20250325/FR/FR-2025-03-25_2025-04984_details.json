  "summary": "The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) staff accepted and docketed an application for the amendment of Special Nuclear Materials (SNM) License No. SNM-2011, submitted by American Centrifuge Operating, LLC, dba ACO dated December 19, 2024. The license amendement request (LAR) would authorize the applicant to modify its NRC license SNM-2011 for the American Centrifuge Plant, located in Piketon, Ohio to account for continued operations (Phase III) for a period of up to 9 years beyond its current authorization expiration date of June 30, 2025. Because the amendment request contains sensitive unclassified non-safeguards information (SUNSI), an order imposes procedures to obtain access to SUNSI for contention preparation by persons who file a hearing request or petition for leave to intervene.",
